"""
Nine different treatments are available for a certain illness: three antibiotics—F, G, and H—three dietary regimens—M, N, and O—and three physical therapies—U, V, and W. For each case of the illness, a doctor will prescribe exactly five of the treatments, in accordance with the following conditions: If two of the antibiotics are prescribed, the remaining antibiotic cannot be prescribed. There must be exactly one dietary regimen prescribed. If O is not prescribed, F cannot be prescribed. If W is prescribed, F cannot be prescribed. G cannot be prescribed if both N and U are prescribed. V cannot be prescribed unless both H and M are prescribed.
Question: If O is prescribed for a given case, which one of the following is a pair of treatments both of which must also be prescribed for that case?
Choices:
(A) F, M
(B) G, V
(C) N, U
(D) U, V
(E) U, W
