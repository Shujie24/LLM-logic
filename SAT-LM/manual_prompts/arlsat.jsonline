{"id": "cot", "style_template": "cot", "prompt": "Nine different treatments are available for a certain illness: three antibiotics\u2014F, G, and H\u2014three dietary regimens\u2014M, N, and O\u2014and three physical therapies\u2014U, V, and W. For each case of the illness, a doctor will prescribe exactly five of the treatments, in accordance with the following conditions: If two of the antibiotics are prescribed, the remaining antibiotic cannot be prescribed. There must be exactly one dietary regimen prescribed. If O is not prescribed, F cannot be prescribed. If W is prescribed, F cannot be prescribed. G cannot be prescribed if both N and U are prescribed. V cannot be prescribed unless both H and M are prescribed.\nQuestion: If O is prescribed for a given case, which one of the following is a pair of treatments both of which must also be prescribed for that case?\nChoices:\n(A) F, M\n(B) G, V\n(C) N, U\n(D) U, V\n(E) U, W\nAnswer:\nLet's first analyze the conditions. We know there must be exactly one dietary regimen prescribed. If O is a prescribed dietary regimen, then M and N must not be prescribed. We know V cannot be prescribed unless both H and M are prescribed, so V cannot be prescribed.\nLet's consider option (A). M must not be prescribed. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (B). V cannot be prescribed. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (C). N must not be prescribed. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (D). V cannot be prescribed. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (E). Let's assume U is not prescribed. Because exactly 5 of the treatments will be prescribed, they must be F, G, H, O, and W. In this way both F and W are prescribed, which contradicts the condition that if W is prescribed, F cannot be prescribed. So U must be prescribed. We can prescribe G, H, O, U, W. This option is True.\nSo the answer is (E).\n\n\n\nEach of five students\u2014Hubert, Lori, Paul, Regina, and Sharon\u2014will visit exactly one of three cities\u2014Montreal, Toronto, or Vancouver\u2014for the month of March, according to the following conditions: Sharon visits a different city than Paul. Hubert visits the same city as Regina. Lori visits Montreal or else Toronto. If Paul visits Vancouver, Hubert visits Vancouver with him. Each student visits one of the cities with at least one of the other four students.\nQuestion: Which one of the following must be true for March?\nChoices:\n(A) If any of the students visits Montreal, Lori visits Montreal.\n(B) If any of the students visits Montreal, exactly two of them do.\n(C) If any of the students visits Toronto, exactly three of them do.\n(D) If any of the students visits Vancouver, Paul visits Vancouver.\n(E) If any of the students visits Vancouver, exactly three of them do.\nAnswer:\nLet's first analyze the conditions. We know each student visits one of the cities with at least one of the other four students, so each city is visited by at least two students. There are five students and three cities. So there must be three students visiting the same city and two other students visiting another city.\nLet's consider option (A). Assume Lori does not visit Montreal. Then Lori visits Toronto. If Sharon visits Toronto with Lori. Paul may visit Montreal. Hubert and Regina can visit Montreal with Paul. So Lori does not necessarily visit Montreal. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (B). Similarly, Paul, Hubert, and Regina can visit Montreal while Lori and Sharon visit Toronto. The option is False.\nLet's consider option (C). Similarly, it is possible that just Lori and Sharon visit Toronto. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (D). Let's assume Paul does not visit Vancouver. Paul and Lori both visit Montreal. Sharon, Hubert, and Regina all visit Vancouver. So Paul does not necessarily visit Vancouver. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (E). If any of the students visit Vancouver, then it must not be Lori. If Paul visits Vancouver, then Sharon must visit the same city as Lori, and Hubert and Regina will visit Vancouver together with Paul. If Paul does not visit Vancouver, then he will visit the same city as Lori. So Sharon will visit Vancouver, together with Hubert and Regina. This option is True.\nSo the answer is (E).\n\n\n\nA travel magazine has hired six interns\u2014Farber, Gombarick, Hall, Jackson, Kanze, and Lha\u2014to assist in covering three stories\u2014Romania, Spain, and Tuscany. Each intern will be trained either as a photographer's assistant or as a writer's assistant. Each story is assigned a team of two interns\u2014one photographer's assistant and one writer's assistant\u2014in accordance with the following conditions: Gombarick and Lha will be trained in the same field. Farber and Kanze will be trained in different fields. Hall will be trained as a photographer's assistant. Jackson is assigned to Tuscany. Kanze is not assigned to Spain.\nQuestion: Which one of the following interns CANNOT be assigned to Tuscany?\nChoices:\n(A) Farber\n(B) Gombarick\n(C) Hall\n(D) Kanze\n(E) Lha\nAnswer:\nLet's first analyze the conditions. Gombarick and Lha will be trained in the same field, so they can\u2019t be assigned to the same story.\nLet's consider option (A). Assume Farber and Jackson are assigned to Tuscany. Kanze is not assigned to Spain. So Kanze has to be assigned to Romania. This is possible. The option is False.\nLet's consider option (B). Assume Gombarick and Jackson are assigned to Tuscany. Kanze is assigned to Romania. This is possible. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (C). Assume Hall and Jackson are assigned to Tuscany. Kanze is assigned to Romania. Assume Gombarick is assigned to Romania as well. Then Lha is assigned to Spain. Farber will be assigned to Spain. Farber and Lha will be trained in the same field, which contradicts the condition that each story is assigned a team of two interns of two different fields. Hall cannot be assigned to Tuscany. This option is True.\nLet's consider option (D). Assume Kanze and Jackson are assigned to Tuscany. This is possible. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (E). Assume Lha and Jackson are assigned to Tuscany. This is possible. This option is False.\nSo the answer is (C).\n\n\n\nIn a repair facility there are exactly six technicians: Stacy, Urma, Wim, Xena, Yolanda, and Zane. Each technician repairs machines of at least one of the following three types\u2014radios, televisions, and VCRs\u2014and no other types. The following conditions apply: Xena and exactly three other technicians repair radios. Yolanda repairs both televisions and VCRs. Stacy does not repair any type of machine that Yolanda repairs. Zane repairs more types of machines than Yolanda repairs. Wim does not repair any type of machine that Stacy repairs. Urma repairs exactly two types of machines.\nQuestion: Which one of the following pairs of technicians could repair all and only the same types of machines as each other?\nChoices:\n(A) Stacy and Urma\n(B) Urma and Yolanda\n(C) Urma and Xena\n(D) Wim and Xena\n(E) Xena and Yolanda\nAnswer:\nLet's first analyze the conditions. We know Yolanda repairs both televisions and VCRs, and Stacy does not repair any type of machine that Yolanda repairs. Given that, each technician repairs machines of at least one of the three types, Stacy can only repair radios, and Yolanda can only repair televisions and VCRs. Zane repairs more types of machines than Yolanda repairs, so Zane can repair all types of machines. Because Wim does not repair any type of machine that Stacy repairs, so Wim does not repair radios. We know Xena and exactly three other technicians repair radios, Yolanda does not repair radios, and Wim does not repair radios, so anyone else should repair radios.\nLet's consider option (A). Stacy can only repair radios, but Urma can repair two types of machines. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (B). Urma repairs radios, but Yolanda does not repair radios. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (C). Both Urma and Xena can repair radios plus one more type, which does lead to conflicts. This option is True.\nLet's consider option (D). Wim does not repair radios, but Xena repairs radios. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (E). Xena repairs radios, but Yolanda does not repair radios. This option is False. \nSo the answer is (C).\n\n\n\nEach of five experts\u2014a lawyer, a naturalist, an oceanographer, a physicist, and a statistician\u2014individually gives exactly one presentation at a conference. The five presentations are given consecutively. Each presentation is in exactly one of the four following languages: French, Hindi, Japanese, or Mandarin. Each expert speaks exactly one of the languages. The following conditions must hold: Exactly two of the presentations are in the same language as each other. The statistician gives the second presentation in Hindi. The lawyer gives the fourth presentation in either Mandarin or French. The oceanographer presents in either French or Japanese; the same is true of the physicist. The first presentation and the last presentation are in Japanese.\nQuestion: Which one of the following could be the order in which the experts give their presentations, from first to last?\nChoices:\n(A) the physicist, the statistician, the lawyer, the naturalist, the oceanographer\n(B) the physicist, the naturalist, the oceanographer, the lawyer, the statistician\n(C) the oceanographer, the statistician, the naturalist, the lawyer, the physicist\n(D) the oceanographer, the statistician, the lawyer, the naturalist, the physicist\nAnswer:\nLet's first analyze the conditions. We know exactly two of the presentations are in the same language as each other and the first presentation and the last presentation are in Japanese. So the second to the fourth presentations are all in different languages other than Japanese.\nLet's consider option (A). The lawyer gives the third presentation, which contradicts the condition that the lawyer gives the fourth presentation. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (B). The naturalist gives the second presentation, which contradicts the condition that the statistician gives the second presentation. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (C). The oceanographer gives the first presentation in Japanese. The statistician gives the second presentation in Hindi. The naturalist gives the third presentation in French. The lawyer gives the fourth presentation in Mandarin. The physicist gives the last presentation in Japanese. This is possible. This option is True.\nLet's consider option (D). The lawyer gives the third presentation, which contradicts the condition that the lawyer gives the fourth presentation. This option is False.\nSo the answer is (C).\n\n\n\nFive candidates for mayor\u2014Q, R, S, T, and U\u2014will each speak exactly once at each of three town meetings\u2014meetings 1, 2, and 3. At each meeting, each candidate will speak in one of five consecutive time slots. No two candidates will speak in the same time slot as each other at any meeting. The order in which the candidates will speak will meet the following conditions: Each candidate must speak either first or second at at least one of the meetings. Any candidate who speaks fifth at any of the meetings must speak first at at least one of the other meetings. No candidate can speak fourth at more than one of the meetings.\nQuestion: If R speaks second at meeting 2 and first at meeting 3, which one of the following is a complete and accurate list of those time slots any one of which could be the time slot in which R speaks at meeting 1?\nChoices:\n(A) fourth, fifth\n(B) first, second, fifth\n(C) second, third, fifth\n(D) third, fourth, fifth\n(E) second, third, fourth, fifth\nAnswer:\nLet's first analyze the conditions. We know R speaks second at meeting 2 and first at meeting 3. Assume R speaks first or second at meeting 1, then there will be only three available first or second slots remaining for all these meetings. Given that there are four other candidates, and each candidate must speak either first or second at least one of the meetings, there won't be enough slots for the others. So R cannot speak first or second at meeting 1. Given R has already spoken first at meeting 3, R has satisfied the requirement that any candidate who speaks fifth at any of the meetings must speak first at least one of the other meetings, so R can speak fifth. Therefore, the accurate and complete list is third, fourth, and fifth.\nLet's consider option (A). This option is False.\nLet's consider option (B). This option is False.\nLet's consider option (C). This option is False.\nLet's consider option (D). This option is True.\nLet's consider option (E). This option is False.\nSo the answer is (D).\n\n\n\nWorkers at a water treatment plant open eight valves\u2014G, H, I, K, L, N, O, and P\u2014to flush out a system of pipes that needs emergency repairs. To maximize safety and efficiency, each valve is opened exactly once, and no two valves are opened at the same time. The valves are opened in accordance with the following conditions: Both K and P are opened before H. O is opened before L but after H. L is opened after G. N is opened before H. I is opened after K.\nQuestion: Each of the following could be the fifth valve opened EXCEPT:\nChoices:\n(A) H\n(B) I\n(C) K\n(D) N\n(E) O\nAnswer:\nLet's first analyze the conditions. We know each valve is opened exactly once, and no two valves are opened at the same time. So the order of opening the valves is unique. We know both K and P are opened before H, and O is opened before L but after H. So both O and L are opened after K and P and then after H. I is also opened after K.\nLet's consider option (A). Assume H is opened fifth, then O, L, and I can be opened after H. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (B). Assume I is opened fifth, H, O, and L can be opened subsequently. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (C). Assume K is opened fifth, H, O, L, and I all need to be opened after K. There are no enough slots. So K cannot be opened fifth. This option is True.\nLet's consider option (D). Assume N is opened fifth. H, O, and L can be opened subsequently. This option is False.\nLet's consider option (E). Assume O is opened fifth. G, L, and I can be opened subsequently. This option is False.\nSo the answer is (C).\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday Vladimir and Wendy each eat exactly four separate meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack. The following is all that is known about what they eat during that day: At no meal does Vladimir eat the same kind of food as Wendy. Neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day. For breakfast, each eats exactly one of the following: hot cakes, poached eggs, or omelet. For lunch, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For dinner, each eats exactly one of the following: fish, hot cakes, macaroni, or omelet. For a snack, each eats exactly one of the following: fish or omelet. Wendy eats an omelet for lunch.\nQuestion: Vladimir must eat which one of the following foods?\nChoices:\n(A) fish\n(B) hot cakes\n(C) macaroni\n(D) omelet\n(E) poached eggs\nAnswer:\nLet's first analyze the conditions. Wendy eats an omelet for lunch. So Vladimir cannot eat omelet for lunch. Because neither of them eats the same kind of food more than once during the day, so Wendy can only eat fish for a snack. As at no meal does Vladimir eat the same kind of food as Wendy, Vladimir has to eat omelet for a snack.\nLet's consider option (A). This option is False.\nLet's consider option (B). This option is False.\nLet's consider option (C). This option is False.\nLet's consider option (D). This option is True.\nLet's consider option (E). This option is False.\nSo the answer is (D)."}
