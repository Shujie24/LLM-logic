The zander is named Tango. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the grizzly bear, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the zander's name, then we can conclude that it does not become an enemy of the viperfish. Rule2: Be careful when something attacks the green fields of the elephant but does not eat the food of the halibut because in this case it will, surely, raise a flag of peace for the ferret (this may or may not be problematic). Rule3: If the viperfish has a musical instrument, then the viperfish eats the food of the halibut. Rule4: Regarding the viperfish, if it took a bike from the store, then we can conclude that it eats the food that belongs to the halibut. Rule5: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals knows the defense plan of the polar bear, you can be certain that it will not respect the viperfish. Rule6: If the viperfish has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then the viperfish attacks the green fields whose owner is the elephant. Rule7: If the viperfish has something to drink, then the viperfish does not eat the food of the halibut. Rule8: If the mosquito winks at the viperfish, then the viperfish is not going to attack the green fields whose owner is the elephant. Rule9: Regarding the viperfish, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the amberjack's name, then we can conclude that it does not eat the food that belongs to the halibut. Rule10: Regarding the hummingbird, if it has fewer than 17 friends, then we can conclude that it respects the viperfish. Rule11: The grizzly bear becomes an actual enemy of the viperfish whenever at least one animal removes from the board one of the pieces of the black bear. Rule12: If the hummingbird respects the viperfish and the grizzly bear does not become an actual enemy of the viperfish, then the viperfish will never raise a peace flag for the ferret.

The grizzly bear has 13 friends. The squirrel burns the warehouse of the grizzly bear. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the grizzly bear, if it has fewer than three friends, then we can conclude that it does not know the defense plan of the zander. Rule2: If the ferret does not steal five of the points of the grizzly bear, then the grizzly bear knows the defensive plans of the kangaroo. Rule3: The grizzly bear unquestionably knows the defensive plans of the zander, in the case where the squirrel burns the warehouse of the grizzly bear. Rule4: If the grizzly bear does not have her keys, then the grizzly bear does not know the defensive plans of the zander. Rule5: If the amberjack knocks down the fortress of the grizzly bear and the aardvark removes from the board one of the pieces of the grizzly bear, then the grizzly bear becomes an enemy of the leopard. Rule6: If at least one animal knows the defense plan of the canary, then the ferret does not steal five of the points of the grizzly bear. Rule7: If the ferret is a fan of Chris Ronaldo, then the ferret steals five points from the grizzly bear. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule4 is preferred over Rule3. Rule6 is preferred over Rule7. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the grizzly bear know the defensive plans of the kangaroo?",
    "proof": "We know the eel knows the defensive plans of the canary, and according to Rule6 \"if at least one animal knows the defensive plans of the canary, then the ferret does not steal five points from the grizzly bear\", and Rule6 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule7), so we can conclude \"the ferret does not steal five points from the grizzly bear\". We know the ferret does not steal five points from the grizzly bear, and according to Rule2 \"if the ferret does not steal five points from the grizzly bear, then the grizzly bear knows the defensive plans of the kangaroo\", so we can conclude \"the grizzly bear knows the defensive plans of the kangaroo\".

Rule2: If you are positive that one of the animals does not hold an equal number of points as the bat, you can be certain that it will not become an actual enemy of the turtle.

Rule4: For the rabbit, if the belief is that the lobster offers a job to the rabbit and the penguin does not attack the green fields of the rabbit, then you can add \"the rabbit does not hold the same number of points as the bat\" to your conclusions. Rule5: The rabbit holds an equal number of points as the bat whenever at least one animal owes $$$ to the baboon. Rule6: If you see that something learns the basics of resource management from the hummingbird but does not roll the dice for the donkey, what can you certainly conclude?

The cricket holds the same number of points as the jellyfish. The grizzly bear rolls the dice for the lion. The parrot has a card that is red in color. The parrot is named Paco. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: For the cricket, if the belief is that the parrot is not going to proceed to the spot right after the cricket but the buffalo rolls the dice for the cricket, then you can add that \"the cricket is not going to prepare armor for the panther\" to your conclusions. Rule2: If the buffalo has something to drink, then the buffalo does not roll the dice for the cricket. Rule3: If you are positive that one of the animals does not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the squirrel, you can be certain that it will prepare armor for the panther without a doubt. Rule4: If something holds an equal number of points as the jellyfish, then it does not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the squirrel. Rule5: Regarding the parrot, if it has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then we can conclude that it does not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the cricket. Rule6: If the parrot has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the cheetah's name, then the parrot does not proceed to the spot right after the cricket. Rule7: Regarding the cricket, if it has more than 10 friends, then we can conclude that it proceeds to the spot right after the squirrel. Rule8: Regarding the buffalo, if it has a high salary, then we can conclude that it does not roll the dice for the cricket. Rule9: If at least one animal rolls the dice for the lion, then the parrot proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the cricket. Rule10: If the buffalo has a card whose color starts with the letter \"y\", then the buffalo rolls the dice for the cricket. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule2 is preferred over Rule10. Rule5 is preferred over Rule9. Rule6 is preferred over Rule9. Rule7 is preferred over Rule4. Rule8 is preferred over Rule10. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the cricket prepare armor for the panther?",
    "proof": "We know the buffalo has a card that is yellow in color, yellow starts with \"y\", and according to Rule10 \"if the buffalo has a card whose color starts with the letter \"y\", then the buffalo rolls the dice for the cricket\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule8 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the buffalo has a high salary\" and for Rule2 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the buffalo has something to drink\", so we can conclude \"the buffalo rolls the dice for the cricket\". We know the parrot has a card that is red in color, red is one of the rainbow colors, and according to Rule5 \"if the parrot has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then the parrot does not proceed to the spot right after the cricket\", and Rule5 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule9), so we can conclude \"the parrot does not proceed to the spot right after the cricket\".

Rule5: If the panther does not proceed to the spot right after the penguin however the dog offers a job position to the penguin, then the penguin will not burn the warehouse of the pig.

We know the panther has a card that is indigo in color, indigo is one of the rainbow colors, and according to Rule7 \"if the panther has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then the panther does not proceed to the spot right after the penguin\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule6 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the panther burns the warehouse of the halibut\", so we can conclude \"the panther does not proceed to the spot right after the penguin\".
