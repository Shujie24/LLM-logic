Rule1: Here is an important piece of information about the stork: if it has more money than the gadwall and the mermaid combined then it does not disarm the lizard for sure. Rule2: The stork will not hide the cards that she has from the goose, in the case where the bulldog does not enjoy the companionship of the stork. Rule3: If the liger surrenders to the stork and the crab borrows one of the weapons of the stork, then the stork brings an oil tank for the liger. Rule4: If the stork has a basketball that fits in a 19.2 x 22.6 x 18.4 inches box, then the stork disarms the lizard. Rule5: The stork will not disarm the lizard if it (the stork) has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the lizard's name. Rule6: Are you certain that one of the animals brings an oil tank for the liger but does not disarm the lizard? Then you can also be certain that the same animal hides the cards that she has from the goose. Rule2 is preferred over Rule6. Rule4 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule5. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the stork hide the cards that she has from the goose?",

We know the stork has 92 dollars, the gadwall has 21 dollars and the mermaid has 5 dollars, 92 is more than 21+5=26 which is the total money of the gadwall and mermaid combined, and according to Rule1 \"if the stork has more money than the gadwall and the mermaid combined, then the stork does not disarm the lizard\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule4 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the stork has a basketball that fits in a 19.2 x 22.6 x 18.4 inches box\", so we can conclude \"the stork does not disarm the lizard\".

The walrus has a football with a radius of 19 inches, and has a piano. The walrus was born 4 and a half years ago. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the peafowl is a fan of Chris Ronaldo, then the peafowl does not destroy the wall built by the walrus. Rule2: In order to conclude that walrus does not destroy the wall built by the dove, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the peafowl destroys the wall constructed by the walrus and secondly the mule wants to see the walrus. Rule3: If the walrus has a football that fits in a 48.8 x 43.3 x 40.6 inches box, then the walrus does not invest in the company whose owner is the dinosaur. Rule4: The walrus will not swear to the bison if it (the walrus) has a musical instrument. Rule5: Regarding the mule, if it has a football that fits in a 70.8 x 53.6 x 52.1 inches box, then we can conclude that it wants to see the walrus. Rule6: Here is an important piece of information about the peafowl: if it is less than 10 months old then it destroys the wall built by the walrus for sure. Rule7: Be careful when something does not swear to the bison and also does not invest in the company owned by the dinosaur because in this case it will surely destroy the wall built by the dove (this may or may not be problematic). Rule8: The peafowl will destroy the wall constructed by the walrus if it (the peafowl) has more money than the dinosaur. Rule9: The walrus will swear to the bison if it (the walrus) is more than 17 months old. Rule10: Here is an important piece of information about the mule: if it is in Turkey at the moment then it wants to see the walrus for sure. Rule2 is preferred over Rule7. Rule4 is preferred over Rule9. Rule6 is preferred over Rule1. Rule8 is preferred over Rule1. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the walrus destroy the wall constructed by the dove?",
    "proof": "We know the mule is currently in Ankara, Ankara is located in Turkey, and according to Rule10 \"if the mule is in Turkey at the moment, then the mule wants to see the walrus\", so we can conclude \"the mule wants to see the walrus\". We know the peafowl has 57 dollars and the dinosaur has 20 dollars, 57 is more than 20 which is the dinosaur's money, and according to Rule8 \"if the peafowl has more money than the dinosaur, then the peafowl destroys the wall constructed by the walrus\", and Rule8 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule1), so we can conclude \"the peafowl destroys the wall constructed by the walrus\". We know the peafowl destroys the wall constructed by the walrus and the mule wants to see the walrus, and according to Rule2 \"if the peafowl destroys the wall constructed by the walrus and the mule wants to see the walrus, then the walrus does not destroy the wall constructed by the dove\", and Rule2 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule7), so we can conclude \"the walrus does not destroy the wall constructed by the dove\".

Rule4: Here is an important piece of information about the zebra: if it is less than five years old then it does not enjoy the company of the badger for sure. Rule5: One of the rules of the game is that if the dugong swims in the pool next to the house of the zebra, then the zebra will never dance with the beaver.

Rule7: The zebra will enjoy the company of the badger if it (the zebra) has a leafy green vegetable. Rule1 is preferred over Rule5. Rule3 is preferred over Rule2. Rule6 is preferred over Rule4.

Rule2: Here is an important piece of information about the gadwall: if it has a football that fits in a 51.6 x 51.3 x 53.7 inches box then it does not create a castle for the cobra for sure. Rule3: For the zebra, if the belief is that the mannikin acquires a photograph of the zebra and the starling does not negotiate a deal with the zebra, then you can add \"the zebra does not capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the gadwall\" to your conclusions. Rule4: The zebra will capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the gadwall if it (the zebra) has a high salary. Rule5: Here is an important piece of information about the gadwall: if it owns a luxury aircraft then it calls the dragonfly for sure. Rule6: If something negotiates a deal with the fangtooth, then it creates a castle for the cobra, too. Rule7: Be careful when something does not create a castle for the cobra but calls the dragonfly because in this case it will, surely, fall on a square that belongs to the ostrich (this may or may not be problematic).

Rule3: Regarding the butterfly, if it has a notebook that fits in a 16.9 x 14.4 inches box, then we can conclude that it does not want to see the bison. Rule4: If the elk does not smile at the bison but the butterfly wants to see the bison, then the bison smiles at the bear unavoidably. Rule5: The elk will smile at the bison if it (the elk) works in marketing. Rule6: If you are positive that one of the animals does not pay money to the liger, you can be certain that it will not disarm the akita. Rule7: Be careful when something does not disarm the akita but hugs the mouse because in this case it certainly does not smile at the bear (this may or may not be problematic). Rule8: If something reveals something that is supposed to be a secret to the poodle, then it does not smile at the bison. Rule9: If something neglects the mule, then it does not hug the mouse. Rule3 is preferred over Rule2. Rule4 is preferred over Rule7. Rule8 is preferred over Rule5. Rule9 is preferred over Rule1. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the bison smile at the bear?",
    "proof": "We know the butterfly has 61 dollars and the seal has 44 dollars, 61 is more than 44 which is the seal's money, and according to Rule2 \"if the butterfly has more money than the seal, then the butterfly wants to see the bison\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule3 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the butterfly has a notebook that fits in a 16.9 x 14.4 inches box\", so we can conclude \"the butterfly wants to see the bison\". We know the elk reveals a secret to the poodle, and according to Rule8 \"if something reveals a secret to the poodle, then it does not smile at the bison\", and Rule8 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule5), so we can conclude \"the elk does not smile at the bison\". We know the elk does not smile at the bison and the butterfly wants to see the bison, and according to Rule4 \"if the elk does not smile at the bison but the butterfly wants to see the bison, then the bison smiles at the bear\", and Rule4 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule7), so we can conclude \"the bison smiles at the bear\".

And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you see that something dances with the monkey and calls the gorilla, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not hide her cards from the mule. Rule2: If the chinchilla has a basketball that fits in a 30.2 x 35.3 x 35.2 inches box, then the chinchilla dances with the monkey. Rule3: In order to conclude that the chinchilla calls the gorilla, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the elk should swim inside the pool located besides the house of the chinchilla and secondly the reindeer should shout at the chinchilla. Rule4: Regarding the chinchilla, if it is watching a movie that was released before the Berlin wall fell, then we can conclude that it does not dance with the monkey. Rule5: The chinchilla will not dance with the monkey if it (the chinchilla) is in Germany at the moment. Rule4 is preferred over Rule2. Rule5 is preferred over Rule2. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the chinchilla hide the cards that she has from the mule?",

We know the chinchilla has a basketball with a diameter of 27 inches, the ball fits in a 30.2 x 35.3 x 35.2 box because the diameter is smaller than all dimensions of the box, and according to Rule2 \"if the chinchilla has a basketball that fits in a 30.2 x 35.3 x 35.2 inches box, then the chinchilla dances with the monkey\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule5 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the chinchilla is in Germany at the moment\" and for Rule4 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the chinchilla is watching a movie that was released before the Berlin wall fell\", so we can conclude \"the chinchilla dances with the monkey\". We know the chinchilla dances with the monkey and the chinchilla calls the gorilla, and according to Rule1 \"if something dances with the monkey and calls the gorilla, then it does not hide the cards that she has from the mule\", so we can conclude \"the chinchilla does not hide the cards that she has from the mule\".
