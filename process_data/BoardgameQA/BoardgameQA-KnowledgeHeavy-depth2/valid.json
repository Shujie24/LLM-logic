Rule4: Regarding the catfish, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the aardvark's name, then we can conclude that it owes $$$ to the elephant. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule1 is preferred over Rule4. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the sea bass sing a victory song for the cheetah?",
    "proof": "We know the catfish stole a bike from the store, and according to Rule3 \"if the catfish took a bike from the store, then the catfish owes money to the elephant\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule1 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the catfish has a card whose color starts with the letter \"g\"\", so we can conclude \"the catfish owes money to the elephant\". We know the catfish owes money to the elephant, and according to Rule2 \"if at least one animal owes money to the elephant, then the sea bass does not sing a victory song for the cheetah\", so we can conclude \"the sea bass does not sing a victory song for the cheetah\". So the statement \"the sea bass sings a victory song for the cheetah\" is disproved and the answer is \"no\".",
    "goal": "(sea bass, sing, cheetah)",
