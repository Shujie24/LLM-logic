The cockroach does not prepare armor for the doctorfish. The cricket does not attack the green fields whose owner is the phoenix. The octopus does not attack the green fields whose owner is the gecko. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the cockroach does not prepare armor for the doctorfish and the black bear does not raise a peace flag for the doctorfish, then the doctorfish holds the same number of points as the eel. Rule2: Regarding the phoenix, if it has more than 3 friends, then we can conclude that it does not owe $$$ to the meerkat. Rule3: If the cricket does not attack the green fields whose owner is the phoenix, then the phoenix owes $$$ to the tilapia. Rule4: The phoenix eats the food of the bat whenever at least one animal knocks down the fortress that belongs to the eel. Rule5: If you see that something owes $$$ to the meerkat and owes money to the tilapia, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not eat the food that belongs to the bat. Rule6: If the phoenix does not have her keys, then the phoenix does not owe money to the tilapia. Rule7: If the phoenix has a sharp object, then the phoenix owes money to the meerkat. Rule8: If the squid has fewer than 14 friends, then the squid respects the baboon. Rule2 is preferred over Rule7. Rule3 is preferred over Rule6. Rule4 is preferred over Rule5. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the phoenix eat the food of the bat?",

We know the phoenix has a blade, blade is a sharp object, and according to Rule7 \"if the phoenix has a sharp object, then the phoenix owes money to the meerkat\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule2 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the phoenix has more than 3 friends\", so we can conclude \"the phoenix owes money to the meerkat\".

Rule2: Regarding the kudu, if it has fewer than 12 friends, then we can conclude that it holds an equal number of points as the squid. Rule3: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals raises a flag of peace for the salmon, you can be certain that it will not hold an equal number of points as the squid. Rule4: Regarding the koala, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the kiwi's name, then we can conclude that it gives a magnifier to the kangaroo. Rule5: Be careful when something shows her cards (all of them) to the doctorfish and also eats the food of the puffin because in this case it will surely not burn the warehouse that is in possession of the meerkat (this may or may not be problematic). Rule6: If at least one animal holds the same number of points as the squid, then the meerkat does not steal five of the points of the tiger. Rule3 is preferred over Rule2. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the meerkat steal five points from the tiger?",
    "proof": "We know the kudu has 2 friends that are kind and 6 friends that are not, so the kudu has 8 friends in total which is fewer than 12, and according to Rule2 \"if the kudu has fewer than 12 friends, then the kudu holds the same number of points as the squid\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule3 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the kudu raises a peace flag for the salmon\", so we can conclude \"the kudu holds the same number of points as the squid\". We know the kudu holds the same number of points as the squid, and according to Rule6 \"if at least one animal holds the same number of points as the squid, then the meerkat does not steal five points from the tiger\", so we can conclude \"the meerkat does not steal five points from the tiger\".

The raven is named Charlie. The sheep has a card that is white in color. The snail has a card that is white in color. The snail is named Bella. The zander attacks the green fields whose owner is the elephant, burns the warehouse of the sheep, and is holding her keys. The zander has a knife. The puffin does not raise a peace flag for the squid. The raven does not remove from the board one of the pieces of the polar bear. The sheep does not knock down the fortress of the wolverine. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the snail has a card whose color appears in the flag of Japan, then the snail does not wink at the dog. Rule2: If the sheep has a card with a primary color, then the sheep does not show all her cards to the whale. Rule3: If the zander does not have her keys, then the zander eats the food of the dog. Rule4: For the dog, if the belief is that the snail is not going to wink at the dog but the zander eats the food of the dog, then you can add that \"the dog is not going to wink at the oscar\" to your conclusions. Rule5: If the zander has a sharp object, then the zander eats the food of the dog. Rule6: Regarding the snail, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the raven's name, then we can conclude that it does not wink at the dog. Rule7: The snail unquestionably winks at the dog, in the case where the mosquito eats the food that belongs to the snail. Rule8: If the octopus has a leafy green vegetable, then the octopus proceeds to the spot right after the catfish. Rule9: The sheep unquestionably shows all her cards to the whale, in the case where the carp holds an equal number of points as the sheep. Rule10: Regarding the sheep, if it has more than one friend, then we can conclude that it does not show all her cards to the whale. Rule10 is preferred over Rule9. Rule2 is preferred over Rule9. Rule7 is preferred over Rule1. Rule7 is preferred over Rule6. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the dog wink at the oscar?",
    "proof": "We know the zander has a knife, knife is a sharp object, and according to Rule5 \"if the zander has a sharp object, then the zander eats the food of the dog\", so we can conclude \"the zander eats the food of the dog\". We know the snail has a card that is white in color, white appears in the flag of Japan, and according to Rule1 \"if the snail has a card whose color appears in the flag of Japan, then the snail does not wink at the dog\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule7 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the mosquito eats the food of the snail\", so we can conclude \"the snail does not wink at the dog\". We know the snail does not wink at the dog and the zander eats the food of the dog, and according to Rule4 \"if the snail does not wink at the dog but the zander eats the food of the dog, then the dog does not wink at the oscar\", so we can conclude \"the dog does not wink at the oscar\".

The raven does not learn the basics of resource management from the cockroach. The squirrel does not offer a job to the turtle, and does not sing a victory song for the salmon. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the hummingbird, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the tiger. Rule2: If the buffalo shows all her cards to the goldfish and the cow raises a peace flag for the goldfish, then the goldfish will not show all her cards to the kudu. Rule3: If something holds the same number of points as the starfish, then it does not eat the food of the goldfish. Rule4: Be careful when something does not show her cards (all of them) to the kudu and also does not give a magnifying glass to the turtle because in this case it will surely become an enemy of the swordfish (this may or may not be problematic). Rule5: If something knocks down the fortress that belongs to the blobfish, then it does not give a magnifier to the turtle. Rule6: The gecko does not steal five of the points of the wolverine whenever at least one animal proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the tilapia. Rule7: If the grasshopper does not know the defensive plans of the eel, then the eel eats the food that belongs to the goldfish. Rule8: If something does not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the pig, then it does not proceed to the spot right after the tiger. Rule9: Regarding the hummingbird, if it owns a luxury aircraft, then we can conclude that it proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the tiger. Rule1 is preferred over Rule8.

The cow does not raise a peace flag for the jellyfish. The lion does not wink at the doctorfish. The moose does not prepare armor for the puffin. The phoenix does not become an enemy of the blobfish. The tilapia does not know the defensive plans of the octopus. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The snail does not remove from the board one of the pieces of the tiger whenever at least one animal owes money to the penguin. Rule2: If the lobster has a device to connect to the internet, then the lobster knows the defensive plans of the amberjack. Rule3: If the eagle does not prepare armor for the lobster, then the lobster does not know the defensive plans of the amberjack. Rule4: If the lobster purchased a time machine, then the lobster knows the defense plan of the amberjack. Rule5: The sun bear prepares armor for the kangaroo whenever at least one animal prepares armor for the puffin. Rule6: If you are positive that one of the animals does not learn the basics of resource management from the tiger, you can be certain that it will owe money to the baboon without a doubt. Rule7: Regarding the penguin, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the panther's name, then we can conclude that it removes from the board one of the pieces of the leopard.
