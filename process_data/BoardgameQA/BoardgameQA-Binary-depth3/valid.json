Rule2: If something proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the cockroach, then it eats the food that belongs to the carp, too. Rule3: Regarding the sheep, if it has a card whose color starts with the letter \"l\", then we can conclude that it raises a flag of peace for the kangaroo. Rule4: Be careful when something raises a flag of peace for the kangaroo and also becomes an actual enemy of the sun bear because in this case it will surely proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the carp (this may or may not be problematic). Rule5: If the sheep does not have her keys, then the sheep becomes an actual enemy of the sun bear. Rule6: If the gecko has something to drink, then the gecko steals five of the points of the dog. Rule7: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals owes money to the halibut, you can be certain that it will also show her cards (all of them) to the panther. Rule8: If the gecko has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the panda bear's name, then the gecko steals five points from the dog. Rule9: Regarding the snail, if it has a leafy green vegetable, then we can conclude that it does not wink at the koala. Rule10: The cricket proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the cockroach whenever at least one animal owes $$$ to the eagle. Rule11: If the sheep has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the tilapia's name, then the sheep becomes an actual enemy of the sun bear. Rule12: If the turtle removes from the board one of the pieces of the snail, then the snail winks at the koala. Rule13: Regarding the sheep, if it has fewer than eight friends, then we can conclude that it raises a flag of peace for the kangaroo. Rule14: For the carp, if the belief is that the sheep proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the carp and the cricket eats the food of the carp, then you can add \"the carp owes money to the squirrel\" to your conclusions. Rule12 is preferred over Rule9. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the carp owe money to the squirrel?",

We know the sheep has 3 friends, 3 is fewer than 8, and according to Rule13 \"if the sheep has fewer than eight friends, then the sheep raises a peace flag for the kangaroo\", so we can conclude \"the sheep raises a peace flag for the kangaroo\". We know the sheep raises a peace flag for the kangaroo and the sheep becomes an enemy of the sun bear, and according to Rule4 \"if something raises a peace flag for the kangaroo and becomes an enemy of the sun bear, then it proceeds to the spot right after the carp\", so we can conclude \"the sheep proceeds to the spot right after the carp\". We know the sheep proceeds to the spot right after the carp and the cricket eats the food of the carp, and according to Rule14 \"if the sheep proceeds to the spot right after the carp and the cricket eats the food of the carp, then the carp owes money to the squirrel\", so we can conclude \"the carp owes money to the squirrel\".

We know the oscar removes from the board one of the pieces of the hippopotamus, and according to Rule3 \"if at least one animal removes from the board one of the pieces of the hippopotamus, then the cat does not show all her cards to the zander\", so we can conclude \"the cat does not show all her cards to the zander\". We know the cat does not show all her cards to the zander and the leopard does not proceed to the spot right after the zander, and according to Rule2 \"if the cat does not show all her cards to the zander and the leopard does not proceed to the spot right after the zander, then the zander, inevitably, attacks the green fields whose owner is the canary\", so we can conclude \"the zander attacks the green fields whose owner is the canary\".

Rule2: If the cow learns the basics of resource management from the dog, then the dog is not going to owe $$$ to the spider. Rule3: If you see that something shows her cards (all of them) to the baboon but does not steal five points from the jellyfish, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it owes money to the phoenix. Rule4: The spider does not owe $$$ to the phoenix, in the case where the dog owes $$$ to the spider. Rule5: Regarding the spider, if it created a time machine, then we can conclude that it raises a peace flag for the eel. Rule6: If something sings a victory song for the mosquito, then it knocks down the fortress that belongs to the spider, too. Rule7: The spider offers a job to the parrot whenever at least one animal becomes an enemy of the buffalo. Rule8: Regarding the spider, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it raises a flag of peace for the eel. Rule9: If something raises a flag of peace for the lobster, then it does not show all her cards to the baboon. Rule10: If the leopard knocks down the fortress of the spider, then the spider is not going to steal five points from the jellyfish. Rule11: If the raven needs the support of the spider and the hare removes one of the pieces of the spider, then the spider will not raise a peace flag for the eel. Rule12: If something raises a peace flag for the eel, then it shows her cards (all of them) to the baboon, too. Rule13: The swordfish shows her cards (all of them) to the donkey whenever at least one animal knows the defense plan of the oscar. Rule14: The dog owes $$$ to the spider whenever at least one animal shows all her cards to the donkey. Rule1 is preferred over Rule13. Rule2 is preferred over Rule14. Rule3 is preferred over Rule4.

Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals rolls the dice for the jellyfish, you can be certain that it will also become an enemy of the canary. Rule2: If you see that something steals five points from the squid and needs the support of the rabbit, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not owe $$$ to the canary. Rule3: If the hippopotamus has more than 1 friend, then the hippopotamus attacks the green fields whose owner is the moose. Rule4: The canary unquestionably needs the support of the cat, in the case where the whale does not owe money to the canary. Rule5: Regarding the hippopotamus, if it has a sharp object, then we can conclude that it attacks the green fields whose owner is the moose. Rule6: If the hippopotamus has difficulty to find food, then the hippopotamus does not attack the green fields whose owner is the moose. Rule7: If the whale has a card whose color starts with the letter \"r\", then the whale does not steal five of the points of the squid. Rule8: Regarding the whale, if it has something to carry apples and oranges, then we can conclude that it needs support from the rabbit. Rule9: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals gives a magnifying glass to the ferret, you can be certain that it will also prepare armor for the baboon. Rule10: The squirrel attacks the green fields of the canary whenever at least one animal attacks the green fields whose owner is the moose. Rule11: Regarding the whale, if it is a fan of Chris Ronaldo, then we can conclude that it steals five points from the squid. Rule12: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals learns elementary resource management from the zander, you can be certain that it will not need the support of the rabbit. Rule13: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals learns the basics of resource management from the gecko, you can be certain that it will not attack the green fields of the canary. Rule14: If the whale has something to sit on, then the whale needs the support of the rabbit. Rule15: If the whale has a leafy green vegetable, then the whale does not steal five points from the squid. Rule16: If the hippopotamus has a sharp object, then the hippopotamus does not attack the green fields whose owner is the moose.

We know the whale does not owe money to the canary, and according to Rule4 \"if the whale does not owe money to the canary, then the canary needs support from the cat\", so we can conclude \"the canary needs support from the cat\".

Rule2: If the moose proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the mosquito, then the mosquito raises a peace flag for the bat. Rule3: If the kudu has a card with a primary color, then the kudu removes from the board one of the pieces of the lion. Rule4: If at least one animal owes $$$ to the cat, then the carp holds an equal number of points as the salmon. Rule5: If the kudu does not have her keys, then the kudu removes from the board one of the pieces of the lion. Rule6: The salmon needs the support of the meerkat whenever at least one animal eats the food that belongs to the polar bear. Rule7: If the mosquito respects the salmon and the carp holds an equal number of points as the salmon, then the salmon will not need the support of the meerkat. Rule8: If at least one animal removes one of the pieces of the lion, then the mosquito respects the salmon. Rule6 is preferred over Rule7.

Rule1: If you see that something raises a peace flag for the koala but does not burn the warehouse that is in possession of the cow, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not knock down the fortress that belongs to the goldfish. Rule2: If the baboon holds the same number of points as the leopard and the hippopotamus owes $$$ to the leopard, then the leopard knocks down the fortress of the goldfish. Rule3: If the leopard has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the donkey's name, then the leopard does not proceed to the spot right after the viperfish. Rule4: If something proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the viperfish, then it burns the warehouse that is in possession of the wolverine, too. Rule5: If you are positive that one of the animals does not knock down the fortress that belongs to the goldfish, you can be certain that it will wink at the caterpillar without a doubt. Rule6: If at least one animal holds the same number of points as the ferret, then the leopard raises a flag of peace for the koala. Rule7: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals rolls the dice for the amberjack, you can be certain that it will not burn the warehouse that is in possession of the cow. Rule8: If something does not sing a victory song for the penguin, then it proceeds to the spot right after the viperfish. Rule9: If the halibut does not need the support of the leopard, then the leopard does not raise a peace flag for the koala. Rule10: Regarding the baboon, if it has a leafy green vegetable, then we can conclude that it does not hold an equal number of points as the leopard. Rule11: Regarding the baboon, if it created a time machine, then we can conclude that it holds an equal number of points as the leopard. Rule10 is preferred over Rule11. Rule2 is preferred over Rule1. Rule6 is preferred over Rule9. Rule8 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the leopard wink at the caterpillar?",
    "proof": "We know the leopard does not sing a victory song for the penguin, and according to Rule8 \"if something does not sing a victory song for the penguin, then it proceeds to the spot right after the viperfish\", and Rule8 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule3), so we can conclude \"the leopard proceeds to the spot right after the viperfish\".

Rule3: If the leopard is a fan of Chris Ronaldo, then the leopard does not knock down the fortress that belongs to the sheep. Rule4: If you see that something becomes an actual enemy of the goldfish but does not knock down the fortress of the sheep, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not prepare armor for the meerkat. Rule5: If the leopard has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the eel's name, then the leopard does not become an actual enemy of the goldfish. Rule6: Regarding the leopard, if it has fewer than 10 friends, then we can conclude that it does not knock down the fortress of the sheep. Rule7: If something does not prepare armor for the meerkat, then it does not wink at the koala. Rule1 is preferred over Rule7. Rule5 is preferred over Rule2. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the leopard wink at the koala?",
