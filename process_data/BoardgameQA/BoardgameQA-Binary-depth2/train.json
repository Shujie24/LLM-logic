The black bear is named Max. The cricket has a card that is indigo in color, has a club chair, and has one friend that is loyal and seven friends that are not. The cricket is named Tango. The kiwi knows the defensive plans of the pig. The spider sings a victory song for the cricket. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the cricket has something to sit on, then the cricket does not steal five points from the hare. Rule2: Regarding the cricket, if it has fewer than ten friends, then we can conclude that it does not steal five points from the sun bear. Rule3: Be careful when something does not steal five of the points of the hare and also does not steal five points from the sun bear because in this case it will surely eat the food of the rabbit (this may or may not be problematic). Rule4: Regarding the amberjack, if it has fewer than eight friends, then we can conclude that it proceeds to the spot right after the cricket. Rule5: If the cricket has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the black bear's name, then the cricket does not steal five points from the hare. Rule6: If the amberjack proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the cricket and the goldfish becomes an actual enemy of the cricket, then the cricket will not eat the food of the rabbit. Rule7: The cricket steals five of the points of the sun bear whenever at least one animal knows the defense plan of the pig. Rule8: If the cricket has a card whose color appears in the flag of Netherlands, then the cricket does not steal five points from the sun bear. Rule9: Regarding the amberjack, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the baboon's name, then we can conclude that it proceeds to the spot right after the cricket. Rule2 is preferred over Rule7. Rule6 is preferred over Rule3. Rule8 is preferred over Rule7. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the cricket eat the food of the rabbit?",
    "proof": "We know the cricket has one friend that is loyal and seven friends that are not, so the cricket has 8 friends in total which is fewer than 10, and according to Rule2 \"if the cricket has fewer than ten friends, then the cricket does not steal five points from the sun bear\", and Rule2 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule7), so we can conclude \"the cricket does not steal five points from the sun bear\". We know the cricket has a club chair, one can sit on a club chair, and according to Rule1 \"if the cricket has something to sit on, then the cricket does not steal five points from the hare\", so we can conclude \"the cricket does not steal five points from the hare\".

Rule2: For the octopus, if the belief is that the kudu does not raise a peace flag for the octopus and the viperfish does not sing a song of victory for the octopus, then you can add \"the octopus raises a peace flag for the zander\" to your conclusions. Rule3: The octopus does not raise a flag of peace for the zander whenever at least one animal attacks the green fields of the bat.
