The hummingbird is named Lily, and raises a peace flag for the pig. The jellyfish is named Paco. The salmon is named Tarzan. The squid has thirteen friends, and does not eat the food of the koala.

Rule1: If you see that something does not hold the same number of points as the cow but it removes from the board one of the pieces of the jellyfish, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also removes one of the pieces of the leopard. Rule2: If the amberjack has fewer than 14 friends, then the amberjack does not learn the basics of resource management from the baboon. Rule3: Regarding the crocodile, if it does not have her keys, then we can conclude that it does not remove from the board one of the pieces of the leopard. Rule4: If the amberjack does not learn elementary resource management from the baboon, then the baboon does not need support from the moose. Rule5: Regarding the amberjack, if it has something to carry apples and oranges, then we can conclude that it does not learn elementary resource management from the baboon. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the baboon need support from the moose?",

Rule1: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals holds the same number of points as the blobfish, you can be certain that it will also give a magnifier to the gecko. Rule2: Regarding the canary, if it has fewer than seven friends, then we can conclude that it does not attack the green fields whose owner is the sheep. Rule3: If the viperfish has a device to connect to the internet, then the viperfish learns elementary resource management from the cheetah. Rule4: If the viperfish has something to sit on, then the viperfish learns the basics of resource management from the cheetah. Rule5: If the canary has a high salary, then the canary attacks the green fields whose owner is the sheep. Rule6: If the canary does not attack the green fields of the sheep but the tilapia eats the food of the sheep, then the sheep eats the food that belongs to the dog unavoidably. Rule7: Be careful when something holds an equal number of points as the grasshopper and also gives a magnifier to the gecko because in this case it will surely not eat the food of the dog (this may or may not be problematic). Rule8: The tilapia unquestionably eats the food of the sheep, in the case where the starfish needs support from the tilapia. Rule9: Regarding the canary, if it has a card whose color appears in the flag of Italy, then we can conclude that it attacks the green fields of the sheep. Rule10: If you are positive that one of the animals does not burn the warehouse of the lobster, you can be certain that it will not give a magnifier to the gecko. Rule10 is preferred over Rule1. Rule5 is preferred over Rule2. Rule7 is preferred over Rule6. Rule9 is preferred over Rule2. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the sheep eat the food of the dog?",
    "proof": "We know the starfish needs support from the tilapia, and according to Rule8 \"if the starfish needs support from the tilapia, then the tilapia eats the food of the sheep\", so we can conclude \"the tilapia eats the food of the sheep\". We know the canary has 2 friends, 2 is fewer than 7, and according to Rule2 \"if the canary has fewer than seven friends, then the canary does not attack the green fields whose owner is the sheep\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule9 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the canary has a card whose color appears in the flag of Italy\" and for Rule5 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the canary has a high salary\", so we can conclude \"the canary does not attack the green fields whose owner is the sheep\".

Rule1: If the oscar has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the ferret's name, then the oscar does not eat the food of the caterpillar. Rule2: For the cheetah, if the belief is that the starfish sings a song of victory for the cheetah and the penguin does not learn the basics of resource management from the cheetah, then you can add \"the cheetah winks at the moose\" to your conclusions. Rule3: If the oscar created a time machine, then the oscar eats the food that belongs to the caterpillar. Rule4: Regarding the penguin, if it has more than eight friends, then we can conclude that it does not learn the basics of resource management from the cheetah. Rule5: The cheetah will not wink at the moose, in the case where the grizzly bear does not give a magnifier to the cheetah. Rule6: If the oscar has fewer than three friends, then the oscar does not eat the food that belongs to the caterpillar. Rule7: If you are positive that one of the animals does not respect the dog, you can be certain that it will learn the basics of resource management from the cheetah without a doubt. Rule8: Regarding the starfish, if it killed the mayor, then we can conclude that it sings a victory song for the cheetah. Rule9: If the penguin has a high salary, then the penguin does not learn elementary resource management from the cheetah. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule5 is preferred over Rule2. Rule6 is preferred over Rule3. Rule7 is preferred over Rule4. Rule7 is preferred over Rule9. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the cheetah wink at the moose?",

Rule2: If the aardvark does not have her keys, then the aardvark does not respect the sun bear. Rule3: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals eats the food of the halibut, you can be certain that it will not attack the green fields of the grasshopper. Rule4: Regarding the octopus, if it has difficulty to find food, then we can conclude that it does not learn elementary resource management from the meerkat. Rule5: Regarding the aardvark, if it has more than 9 friends, then we can conclude that it does not respect the sun bear. Rule6: If at least one animal owes money to the penguin, then the cricket does not need the support of the meerkat. Rule7: If the octopus has a leafy green vegetable, then the octopus learns the basics of resource management from the meerkat. Rule8: Regarding the octopus, if it has more than eight friends, then we can conclude that it does not learn the basics of resource management from the meerkat. Rule9: If something attacks the green fields whose owner is the black bear, then it eats the food that belongs to the halibut, too. Rule10: Regarding the cricket, if it has a card whose color appears in the flag of Netherlands, then we can conclude that it needs support from the meerkat. Rule11: Regarding the octopus, if it has a card whose color starts with the letter \"y\", then we can conclude that it learns elementary resource management from the meerkat. Rule12: If the cricket has a high salary, then the cricket needs the support of the meerkat. Rule10 is preferred over Rule6. Rule12 is preferred over Rule6. Rule2 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule11. Rule4 is preferred over Rule7. Rule5 is preferred over Rule1. Rule8 is preferred over Rule11. Rule8 is preferred over Rule7. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the meerkat attack the green fields whose owner is the grasshopper?",
    "proof": "We know the meerkat attacks the green fields whose owner is the black bear, and according to Rule9 \"if something attacks the green fields whose owner is the black bear, then it eats the food of the halibut\", so we can conclude \"the meerkat eats the food of the halibut\". We know the meerkat eats the food of the halibut, and according to Rule3 \"if something eats the food of the halibut, then it does not attack the green fields whose owner is the grasshopper\", so we can conclude \"the meerkat does not attack the green fields whose owner is the grasshopper\".

The grasshopper eats the food of the grizzly bear. The hare winks at the sheep. The salmon dreamed of a luxury aircraft. The viperfish owes money to the canary. The donkey does not respect the panda bear. The kudu does not become an enemy of the turtle. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The salmon unquestionably attacks the green fields whose owner is the eagle, in the case where the buffalo proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the salmon. Rule2: If the eagle has a high salary, then the eagle does not steal five of the points of the caterpillar. Rule3: Regarding the canary, if it killed the mayor, then we can conclude that it does not need support from the black bear. Rule4: Regarding the eagle, if it has something to drink, then we can conclude that it does not give a magnifying glass to the goldfish. Rule5: If the grasshopper eats the food that belongs to the grizzly bear, then the grizzly bear is not going to know the defensive plans of the eagle. Rule6: If the salmon attacks the green fields of the eagle and the grizzly bear does not know the defensive plans of the eagle, then, inevitably, the eagle learns the basics of resource management from the parrot. Rule7: If the eagle has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the octopus's name, then the eagle gives a magnifying glass to the goldfish. Rule8: Regarding the salmon, if it has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then we can conclude that it does not attack the green fields whose owner is the eagle. Rule9: If the eagle has a card whose color starts with the letter \"i\", then the eagle does not steal five points from the caterpillar. Rule10: Regarding the salmon, if it owns a luxury aircraft, then we can conclude that it does not attack the green fields of the eagle. Rule10 is preferred over Rule1. Rule7 is preferred over Rule4. Rule8 is preferred over Rule1. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the eagle learn the basics of resource management from the parrot?",
