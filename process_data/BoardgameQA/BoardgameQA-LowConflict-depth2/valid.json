    "proof": "We know the kiwi does not sing a victory song for the crocodile, and according to Rule2 \"if the kiwi does not sing a victory song for the crocodile, then the crocodile does not proceed to the spot right after the oscar\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule1 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the crocodile removes from the board one of the pieces of the goldfish\", so we can conclude \"the crocodile does not proceed to the spot right after the oscar\". We know the crocodile does not proceed to the spot right after the oscar, and according to Rule3 \"if something does not proceed to the spot right after the oscar, then it eats the food of the kudu\", so we can conclude \"the crocodile eats the food of the kudu\".
