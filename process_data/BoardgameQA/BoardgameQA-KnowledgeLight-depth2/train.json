Rule1: For the sea bass, if the belief is that the zander holds an equal number of points as the sea bass and the cockroach does not attack the green fields whose owner is the sea bass, then you can add \"the sea bass does not give a magnifying glass to the lobster\" to your conclusions.

And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The amberjack offers a job to the turtle whenever at least one animal burns the warehouse of the raven. Rule2: Regarding the turtle, if it has a leafy green vegetable, then we can conclude that it does not attack the green fields whose owner is the cricket. Rule3: If the doctorfish gives a magnifying glass to the turtle, then the turtle proceeds to the spot right after the polar bear. Rule4: For the turtle, if the belief is that the amberjack offers a job to the turtle and the panda bear rolls the dice for the turtle, then you can add \"the turtle attacks the green fields whose owner is the baboon\" to your conclusions. Rule5: Regarding the amberjack, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the goldfish's name, then we can conclude that it does not offer a job position to the turtle. Rule6: If the turtle took a bike from the store, then the turtle does not attack the green fields whose owner is the cricket. Rule7: If the panda bear has a card whose color appears in the flag of France, then the panda bear rolls the dice for the turtle. Rule8: If you see that something attacks the green fields of the cricket and proceeds to the spot right after the polar bear, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not attack the green fields of the baboon. Rule9: If the polar bear sings a victory song for the turtle, then the turtle attacks the green fields of the cricket. Rule2 is preferred over Rule9. Rule4 is preferred over Rule8. Rule5 is preferred over Rule1. Rule6 is preferred over Rule9. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the turtle attack the green fields whose owner is the baboon?",
    "proof": "We know the panda bear has a card that is white in color, white appears in the flag of France, and according to Rule7 \"if the panda bear has a card whose color appears in the flag of France, then the panda bear rolls the dice for the turtle\", so we can conclude \"the panda bear rolls the dice for the turtle\". We know the zander burns the warehouse of the raven, and according to Rule1 \"if at least one animal burns the warehouse of the raven, then the amberjack offers a job to the turtle\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule5 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the amberjack has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the goldfish's name\", so we can conclude \"the amberjack offers a job to the turtle\".
