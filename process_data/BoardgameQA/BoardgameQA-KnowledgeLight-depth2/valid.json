The hummingbird has a card that is white in color. The hummingbird is named Chickpea. The jellyfish is named Charlie. The elephant does not know the defensive plans of the parrot. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The parrot does not eat the food of the lobster, in the case where the eel offers a job to the parrot. Rule2: If the hummingbird has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the jellyfish's name, then the hummingbird does not remove one of the pieces of the lobster. Rule3: If the parrot eats the food that belongs to the lobster, then the lobster proceeds to the spot right after the panda bear. Rule4: If the elephant does not know the defense plan of the parrot, then the parrot eats the food of the lobster. Rule5: If the hummingbird removes from the board one of the pieces of the lobster and the doctorfish rolls the dice for the lobster, then the lobster will not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the panda bear. Rule6: Regarding the hummingbird, if it has more than ten friends, then we can conclude that it removes one of the pieces of the lobster. Rule7: If the hummingbird has a sharp object, then the hummingbird removes from the board one of the pieces of the lobster. Rule1 is preferred over Rule4. Rule5 is preferred over Rule3.
