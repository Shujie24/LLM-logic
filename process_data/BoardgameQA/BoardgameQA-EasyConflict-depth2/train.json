The swordfish has a backpack, has three friends that are playful and four friends that are not, and does not learn the basics of resource management from the baboon. The swordfish has a card that is green in color. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If you see that something becomes an enemy of the spider and rolls the dice for the cheetah, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not attack the green fields of the tilapia. Rule2: Regarding the swordfish, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it becomes an enemy of the spider. Rule3: Regarding the swordfish, if it has more than 4 friends, then we can conclude that it rolls the dice for the cheetah. Rule4: Regarding the carp, if it took a bike from the store, then we can conclude that it becomes an enemy of the halibut. Rule5: If the swordfish has a leafy green vegetable, then the swordfish becomes an enemy of the spider. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the swordfish attack the green fields whose owner is the tilapia?",
