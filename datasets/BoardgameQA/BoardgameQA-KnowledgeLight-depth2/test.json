The songbird reveals a secret to the peafowl. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the rhino, if it has a football that fits in a 35.3 x 38.5 x 37.2 inches box, then we can conclude that it does not reveal something that is supposed to be a secret to the swan. Rule2: If you see that something reveals a secret to the peafowl but does not pay money to the monkey, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not fall on a square that belongs to the swan. Rule3: There exists an animal which calls the owl? Then the songbird definitely falls on a square that belongs to the swan. Rule4: In order to conclude that the swan does not call the dolphin, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly that the rhino will not reveal something that is supposed to be a secret to the swan and secondly the songbird falls on a square that belongs to the swan. Rule2 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the swan call the dolphin?",
    "proof": "We know the pigeon calls the owl, and according to Rule3 \"if at least one animal calls the owl, then the songbird falls on a square of the swan\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule2 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the songbird does not pay money to the monkey\", so we can conclude \"the songbird falls on a square of the swan\". We know the rhino has a football with a radius of 15 inches, the diameter=2*radius=30.0 so the ball fits in a 35.3 x 38.5 x 37.2 box because the diameter is smaller than all dimensions of the box, and according to Rule1 \"if the rhino has a football that fits in a 35.3 x 38.5 x 37.2 inches box, then the rhino does not reveal a secret to the swan\", so we can conclude \"the rhino does not reveal a secret to the swan\". We know the rhino does not reveal a secret to the swan and the songbird falls on a square of the swan, and according to Rule4 \"if the rhino does not reveal a secret to the swan but the songbird falls on a square of the swan, then the swan does not call the dolphin\", so we can conclude \"the swan does not call the dolphin\".

The dolphin shouts at the swan. The monkey has a 13 x 15 inches notebook. The swan does not take over the emperor of the finch. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If at least one animal shouts at the swan, then the monkey does not hide her cards from the peafowl. Rule2: If the bear borrows a weapon from the peafowl and the monkey does not hide the cards that she has from the peafowl, then the peafowl will never manage to convince the seal. Rule3: The monkey will hide the cards that she has from the peafowl if it (the monkey) has a notebook that fits in a 11.3 x 10.5 inches box. Rule4: This is a basic rule: if the dachshund does not tear down the castle that belongs to the bear, then the conclusion that the bear will not borrow a weapon from the peafowl follows immediately and effectively. Rule5: If something does not take over the emperor of the finch, then it negotiates a deal with the husky. Rule6: Are you certain that one of the animals manages to convince the mannikin and also at the same time dances with the german shepherd? Then you can also be certain that the same animal borrows one of the weapons of the peafowl. Rule7: The peafowl manages to persuade the seal whenever at least one animal negotiates a deal with the husky. Rule8: Regarding the monkey, if it is watching a movie that was released before Google was founded, then we can conclude that it hides her cards from the peafowl. Rule2 is preferred over Rule7. Rule3 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule6. Rule8 is preferred over Rule1. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the peafowl manage to convince the seal?",

The dachshund has 15 friends, has a card that is orange in color, and is named Beauty. The dachshund invented a time machine. The seahorse is named Lily. The walrus is named Lola. The walrus parked her bike in front of the store. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the walrus took a bike from the store, then the walrus smiles at the rhino. Rule2: Regarding the dachshund, if it has a card with a primary color, then we can conclude that it borrows a weapon from the rhino. Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the dachshund: if it created a time machine then it borrows a weapon from the rhino for sure. Rule4: There exists an animal which takes over the emperor of the vampire? Then, the walrus definitely does not smile at the rhino. Rule5: For the rhino, if the belief is that the walrus smiles at the rhino and the dachshund borrows one of the weapons of the rhino, then you can add \"the rhino takes over the emperor of the butterfly\" to your conclusions. Rule6: The dachshund will not borrow a weapon from the rhino if it (the dachshund) has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the bear's name. Rule7: The walrus will smile at the rhino if it (the walrus) has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the seahorse's name. Rule2 is preferred over Rule6. Rule3 is preferred over Rule6. Rule4 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule7. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the rhino take over the emperor of the butterfly?",
    "proof": "We know the dachshund invented a time machine, and according to Rule3 \"if the dachshund created a time machine, then the dachshund borrows one of the weapons of the rhino\", and Rule3 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule6), so we can conclude \"the dachshund borrows one of the weapons of the rhino\". We know the walrus is named Lola and the seahorse is named Lily, both names start with \"L\", and according to Rule7 \"if the walrus has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the seahorse's name, then the walrus smiles at the rhino\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule4 we cannot prove the antecedent \"at least one animal takes over the emperor of the vampire\", so we can conclude \"the walrus smiles at the rhino\". We know the walrus smiles at the rhino and the dachshund borrows one of the weapons of the rhino, and according to Rule5 \"if the walrus smiles at the rhino and the dachshund borrows one of the weapons of the rhino, then the rhino takes over the emperor of the butterfly\", so we can conclude \"the rhino takes over the emperor of the butterfly\".

Rule1: Be careful when something does not refuse to help the mermaid but builds a power plant near the green fields of the butterfly because in this case it will, surely, capture the king of the lizard (this may or may not be problematic). Rule2: If the swallow captures the king of the lizard and the dinosaur takes over the emperor of the lizard, then the lizard disarms the goat.

And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If something does not hide the cards that she has from the worm, then it does not hug the walrus. Rule2: The lizard does not unite with the swallow whenever at least one animal captures the king of the dove. Rule3: For the swallow, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) that the pelikan does not fall on a square of the swallow and 2) that the lizard does not unite with the swallow, then you can add swallow hugs the walrus to your conclusions. Rule4: One of the rules of the game is that if the shark captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the lizard, then the lizard will, without hesitation, unite with the swallow. Rule5: If you see that something does not stop the victory of the basenji and also does not call the songbird, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also does not hide her cards from the worm. Rule6: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals enjoys the company of the bison, you can be certain that it will not fall on a square of the swallow. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule2 is preferred over Rule4. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the swallow hug the walrus?",
    "proof": "We know the swallow does not stop the victory of the basenji and the swallow does not call the songbird, and according to Rule5 \"if something does not stop the victory of the basenji and does not call the songbird, then it does not hide the cards that she has from the worm\", so we can conclude \"the swallow does not hide the cards that she has from the worm\". We know the swallow does not hide the cards that she has from the worm, and according to Rule1 \"if something does not hide the cards that she has from the worm, then it doesn't hug the walrus\", and Rule1 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule3), so we can conclude \"the swallow does not hug the walrus\".
