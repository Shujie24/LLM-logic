The spider is named Teddy. The swordfish has a backpack, has a card that is red in color, has a trumpet, and is named Tango. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the canary, if it has a card whose color starts with the letter \"v\", then we can conclude that it does not know the defense plan of the polar bear. Rule2: Regarding the swordfish, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the spider's name, then we can conclude that it attacks the green fields of the polar bear. Rule3: If the canary knows the defense plan of the polar bear, then the polar bear is not going to raise a flag of peace for the kudu. Rule4: Be careful when something eats the food of the lion but does not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the pig because in this case it will, surely, know the defense plan of the polar bear (this may or may not be problematic). Rule5: If the swordfish has a sharp object, then the swordfish attacks the green fields whose owner is the polar bear. Rule6: If the swordfish has a card whose color appears in the flag of Belgium, then the swordfish does not attack the green fields of the polar bear. Rule7: If the swordfish attacks the green fields whose owner is the polar bear and the ferret offers a job to the polar bear, then the polar bear raises a peace flag for the kudu. Rule1 is preferred over Rule4. Rule2 is preferred over Rule6. Rule5 is preferred over Rule6. Rule7 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the polar bear raise a peace flag for the kudu?",
    "proof": "We know the canary eats the food of the lion and the canary does not proceed to the spot right after the pig, and according to Rule4 \"if something eats the food of the lion but does not proceed to the spot right after the pig, then it knows the defensive plans of the polar bear\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule1 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the canary has a card whose color starts with the letter \"v\"\", so we can conclude \"the canary knows the defensive plans of the polar bear\".
