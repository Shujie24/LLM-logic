Rule1: For the liger, if the belief is that the gorilla disarms the liger and the butterfly reveals a secret to the liger, then you can add that \"the liger is not going to create a castle for the worm\" to your conclusions. Rule2: One of the rules of the game is that if the wolf refuses to help the gorilla, then the gorilla will never disarm the liger. Rule3: From observing that one animal tears down the castle of the peafowl, one can conclude that it also reveals a secret to the liger, undoubtedly. Rule4: One of the rules of the game is that if the gorilla does not shout at the liger, then the liger will, without hesitation, create a castle for the worm. Rule5: If the gorilla has a basketball that fits in a 27.1 x 11.9 x 24.5 inches box, then the gorilla does not shout at the liger. Rule6: If the gorilla has difficulty to find food, then the gorilla disarms the liger. Rule7: Regarding the gorilla, if it works in healthcare, then we can conclude that it disarms the liger. Rule8: The gorilla will not shout at the liger if it (the gorilla) is in Africa at the moment. Rule1 is preferred over Rule4. Rule2 is preferred over Rule6. Rule2 is preferred over Rule7. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the liger create one castle for the worm?",
    "proof": "We know the butterfly tears down the castle that belongs to the peafowl, and according to Rule3 \"if something tears down the castle that belongs to the peafowl, then it reveals a secret to the liger\", so we can conclude \"the butterfly reveals a secret to the liger\". We know the gorilla struggles to find food, and according to Rule6 \"if the gorilla has difficulty to find food, then the gorilla disarms the liger\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule2 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the wolf refuses to help the gorilla\", so we can conclude \"the gorilla disarms the liger\".

The basenji does not destroy the wall constructed by the stork. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: For the stork, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) that the beetle does not leave the houses occupied by the stork and 2) that the basenji does not destroy the wall built by the stork, then you can add that the stork will never leave the houses occupied by the cougar to your conclusions. Rule2: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals wants to see the crab, you can be certain that it will not smile at the owl. Rule3: The living creature that does not hug the zebra will surrender to the chihuahua with no doubts. Rule4: Regarding the stork, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the dugong's name, then we can conclude that it leaves the houses that are occupied by the cougar. Rule5: Regarding the stork, if it has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then we can conclude that it wants to see the crab. Rule6: If the stork works in marketing, then the stork wants to see the crab. Rule7: The stork will leave the houses that are occupied by the cougar if it (the stork) is less than twenty weeks old.

The dinosaur suspects the truthfulness of the seahorse. The goose falls on a square of the seahorse. The rhino builds a power plant near the green fields of the otter. The seahorse is a marketing manager, and is currently in  Hamburg. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: For the seahorse, if the belief is that the rhino is not going to tear down the castle that belongs to the seahorse but the bulldog takes over the emperor of the seahorse, then you can add that \"the seahorse is not going to refuse to help the goat\" to your conclusions. Rule2: If something does not manage to convince the mannikin but tears down the castle that belongs to the dalmatian, then it refuses to help the goat. Rule3: One of the rules of the game is that if the goose falls on a square that belongs to the seahorse, then the seahorse will never manage to convince the mannikin. Rule4: If the akita suspects the truthfulness of the seahorse, then the seahorse tears down the castle of the dalmatian. Rule5: If something builds a power plant near the green fields of the otter, then it does not tear down the castle of the seahorse. Rule6: Here is an important piece of information about the seahorse: if it is in Germany at the moment then it manages to persuade the mannikin for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2. Rule3 is preferred over Rule6. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the seahorse refuse to help the goat?",

Rule5: If you are positive that one of the animals does not build a power plant close to the green fields of the reindeer, you can be certain that it will not reveal a secret to the songbird.

Rule5: Be careful when something does not call the pelikan and also does not swim inside the pool located besides the house of the cougar because in this case it will surely trade one of its pieces with the reindeer (this may or may not be problematic).

The mannikin does not manage to convince the cougar. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The cougar will not create one castle for the cobra if it (the cougar) has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the akita's name. Rule2: If the cougar has fewer than four friends, then the cougar does not create a castle for the cobra. Rule3: One of the rules of the game is that if the mannikin does not manage to persuade the cougar, then the cougar will, without hesitation, create a castle for the cobra. Rule4: Be careful when something surrenders to the stork and also creates a castle for the cobra because in this case it will surely not dance with the seal (this may or may not be problematic). Rule5: For the cougar, if the belief is that the starling captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the cougar and the coyote negotiates a deal with the cougar, then you can add \"the cougar surrenders to the stork\" to your conclusions.

Rule1: Regarding the seahorse, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the chinchilla's name, then we can conclude that it does not enjoy the company of the gorilla. Rule2: If you see that something enjoys the companionship of the gorilla and neglects the bear, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also hides the cards that she has from the chihuahua. Rule3: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals invests in the company whose owner is the bulldog, you can be certain that it will also enjoy the companionship of the gorilla. Rule4: Regarding the dinosaur, if it has a notebook that fits in a 17.4 x 13.5 inches box, then we can conclude that it unites with the seahorse. Rule5: Regarding the vampire, if it has a leafy green vegetable, then we can conclude that it neglects the seahorse. Rule6: The vampire will neglect the seahorse if it (the vampire) is more than 22 and a half weeks old. Rule7: The seahorse unquestionably neglects the bear, in the case where the walrus builds a power plant close to the green fields of the seahorse. Rule8: In order to conclude that seahorse does not hide her cards from the chihuahua, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the dinosaur unites with the seahorse and secondly the vampire neglects the seahorse. Rule9: Regarding the seahorse, if it has more than one friend, then we can conclude that it does not enjoy the company of the gorilla. Rule10: Here is an important piece of information about the dinosaur: if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the dolphin's name then it unites with the seahorse for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Rule2 is preferred over Rule8. Rule9 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the seahorse hide the cards that she has from the chihuahua?",

We know the seahorse invests in the company whose owner is the bulldog, and according to Rule3 \"if something invests in the company whose owner is the bulldog, then it enjoys the company of the gorilla\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule9 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the seahorse has more than one friend\" and for Rule1 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the seahorse has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the chinchilla's name\", so we can conclude \"the seahorse enjoys the company of the gorilla\".

Rule1: If the vampire is a fan of Chris Ronaldo, then the vampire pays some $$$ to the gorilla. Rule2: Are you certain that one of the animals falls on a square that belongs to the leopard and also at the same time pays some $$$ to the gorilla? Then you can also be certain that the same animal swims inside the pool located besides the house of the worm. Rule3: The vampire will fall on a square of the leopard if it (the vampire) has a notebook that fits in a 7.3 x 6.7 inches box. Rule4: The vampire will fall on a square that belongs to the leopard if it (the vampire) works in education.
