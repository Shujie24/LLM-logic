Rule8: Regarding the canary, if it has more than 6 friends, then we can conclude that it does not wink at the mosquito.

We know the baboon has some romaine lettuce, romaine lettuce is a leafy green vegetable, and according to Rule16 \"if the baboon has a leafy green vegetable, then the baboon does not become an enemy of the canary\", and Rule16 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule10), so we can conclude \"the baboon does not become an enemy of the canary\".

We know the canary needs support from the hare, and according to Rule12 \"if something needs support from the hare, then it does not proceed to the spot right after the whale\", so we can conclude \"the canary does not proceed to the spot right after the whale\".

Rule1: If you are positive that one of the animals does not attack the green fields whose owner is the turtle, you can be certain that it will not prepare armor for the ferret. Rule2: Regarding the baboon, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the lobster's name, then we can conclude that it attacks the green fields whose owner is the turtle. Rule3: Regarding the baboon, if it took a bike from the store, then we can conclude that it does not attack the green fields of the turtle. Rule4: The ferret unquestionably owes $$$ to the sea bass, in the case where the baboon does not prepare armor for the ferret. Rule5: If the baboon has more than 4 friends, then the baboon holds an equal number of points as the leopard.

The halibut knows the defensive plans of the cockroach. The hummingbird burns the warehouse of the tilapia but does not become an enemy of the carp. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If something eats the food that belongs to the donkey, then it winks at the swordfish, too. Rule2: If something does not show her cards (all of them) to the salmon, then it does not need support from the lobster. Rule3: If the halibut knows the defense plan of the cockroach and the gecko removes one of the pieces of the cockroach, then the cockroach burns the warehouse of the buffalo. Rule4: Be careful when something burns the warehouse of the tilapia but does not become an enemy of the carp because in this case it will, surely, need support from the lobster (this may or may not be problematic). Rule5: If the hummingbird needs support from the lobster, then the lobster eats the food that belongs to the donkey.

Rule2: Be careful when something eats the food that belongs to the tilapia and also knows the defensive plans of the goldfish because in this case it will surely not offer a job position to the gecko (this may or may not be problematic). Rule3: If the wolverine has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the octopus's name, then the wolverine becomes an enemy of the crocodile. Rule4: The bat eats the food that belongs to the wolverine whenever at least one animal knocks down the fortress of the panda bear.

Rule9: For the gecko, if the belief is that the cat does not offer a job to the gecko but the wolverine knocks down the fortress of the gecko, then you can add \"the gecko knows the defensive plans of the halibut\" to your conclusions. Rule10: If you are positive that one of the animals does not know the defense plan of the donkey, you can be certain that it will eat the food that belongs to the tilapia without a doubt. Rule11: If the tilapia has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the parrot's name, then the tilapia respects the pig. Rule7 is preferred over Rule1.

    "proof": "We know the cricket prepares armor for the sun bear, and according to Rule9 \"if the cricket prepares armor for the sun bear, then the sun bear proceeds to the spot right after the tiger\", so we can conclude \"the sun bear proceeds to the spot right after the tiger\".
