Rule3: If the carp has a card whose color appears in the flag of Italy, then the carp does not show all her cards to the rabbit. Rule4: If the carp shows all her cards to the rabbit, then the rabbit knows the defense plan of the gecko. Rule2 is preferred over Rule3.

The mosquito does not proceed to the spot right after the whale. The parrot does not sing a victory song for the mosquito. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the mosquito has a card with a primary color, then the mosquito knows the defense plan of the kudu. Rule2: If you see that something learns elementary resource management from the aardvark and knows the defensive plans of the kudu, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not raise a flag of peace for the carp. Rule3: If the mosquito has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the hummingbird's name, then the mosquito learns the basics of resource management from the aardvark. Rule4: The mosquito does not know the defense plan of the kudu whenever at least one animal sings a song of victory for the raven. Rule5: Regarding the mosquito, if it took a bike from the store, then we can conclude that it learns the basics of resource management from the aardvark. Rule6: If something sings a victory song for the rabbit, then it raises a peace flag for the carp, too. Rule7: For the mosquito, if the belief is that the parrot does not sing a victory song for the mosquito but the kudu needs support from the mosquito, then you can add \"the mosquito sings a song of victory for the rabbit\" to your conclusions. Rule1 is preferred over Rule4. Rule6 is preferred over Rule2. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the mosquito raise a peace flag for the carp?",
    "proof": "We know the parrot does not sing a victory song for the mosquito and the kudu needs support from the mosquito, and according to Rule7 \"if the parrot does not sing a victory song for the mosquito but the kudu needs support from the mosquito, then the mosquito sings a victory song for the rabbit\", so we can conclude \"the mosquito sings a victory song for the rabbit\". We know the mosquito sings a victory song for the rabbit, and according to Rule6 \"if something sings a victory song for the rabbit, then it raises a peace flag for the carp\", and Rule6 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule2), so we can conclude \"the mosquito raises a peace flag for the carp\".
