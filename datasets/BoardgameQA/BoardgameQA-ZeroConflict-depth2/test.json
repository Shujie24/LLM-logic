    "example": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The zebra builds a power plant near the green fields of the dolphin, and has a card that is black in color. The zebra has a tablet. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Are you certain that one of the animals hugs the camel and also at the same time neglects the rhino? Then you can also be certain that the same animal brings an oil tank for the reindeer. Rule2: Regarding the zebra, if it has a device to connect to the internet, then we can conclude that it hugs the camel. Rule3: If something builds a power plant near the green fields of the dolphin, then it neglects the rhino, too. Rule4: Here is an important piece of information about the zebra: if it has a card with a primary color then it hugs the camel for sure. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the zebra bring an oil tank for the reindeer?",
    "proof": "We know the zebra has a tablet, tablet can be used to connect to the internet, and according to Rule2 \"if the zebra has a device to connect to the internet, then the zebra hugs the camel\", so we can conclude \"the zebra hugs the camel\". We know the zebra builds a power plant near the green fields of the dolphin, and according to Rule3 \"if something builds a power plant near the green fields of the dolphin, then it neglects the rhino\", so we can conclude \"the zebra neglects the rhino\". We know the zebra neglects the rhino and the zebra hugs the camel, and according to Rule1 \"if something neglects the rhino and hugs the camel, then it brings an oil tank for the reindeer\", so we can conclude \"the zebra brings an oil tank for the reindeer\". So the statement \"the zebra brings an oil tank for the reindeer\" is proved and the answer is \"yes\".",
    "goal": "(zebra, bring, reindeer)",
