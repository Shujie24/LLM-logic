Rule1: Regarding the goose, if it has a football that fits in a 49.6 x 42.1 x 62.7 inches box, then we can conclude that it invests in the company whose owner is the vampire. Rule2: If the goose has more money than the stork, then the goose invests in the company owned by the vampire.

Rule3: Regarding the leopard, if it is watching a movie that was released after covid started, then we can conclude that it borrows one of the weapons of the dugong. Rule4: Regarding the dugong, if it has more money than the coyote, then we can conclude that it pays money to the coyote. Rule5: In order to conclude that dugong does not invest in the company owned by the zebra, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly the peafowl suspects the truthfulness of the dugong and secondly the leopard borrows one of the weapons of the dugong. Rule6: If the dugong has a leafy green vegetable, then the dugong does not pay some $$$ to the coyote. Rule7: Regarding the leopard, if it is in Africa at the moment, then we can conclude that it borrows one of the weapons of the dugong. Rule8: Here is an important piece of information about the peafowl: if it has a card whose color starts with the letter \"b\" then it does not suspect the truthfulness of the dugong for sure. Rule9: Here is an important piece of information about the dugong: if it works in marketing then it does not pay money to the coyote for sure. Rule10: Here is an important piece of information about the peafowl: if it has more than 12 friends then it does not suspect the truthfulness of the dugong for sure. Rule11: Here is an important piece of information about the dugong: if it has fewer than 3 friends then it enjoys the company of the otter for sure. Rule12: Here is an important piece of information about the peafowl: if it works in computer science and engineering then it suspects the truthfulness of the dugong for sure. Rule13: Here is an important piece of information about the dugong: if it has a device to connect to the internet then it enjoys the company of the otter for sure. Rule10 is preferred over Rule1. Rule10 is preferred over Rule12. Rule5 is preferred over Rule2. Rule6 is preferred over Rule4. Rule8 is preferred over Rule1. Rule8 is preferred over Rule12. Rule9 is preferred over Rule4.

    "proof": "We know the leopard is watching a movie from 2023, 2023 is after 2019 which is the year covid started, and according to Rule3 \"if the leopard is watching a movie that was released after covid started, then the leopard borrows one of the weapons of the dugong\", so we can conclude \"the leopard borrows one of the weapons of the dugong\". We know the peafowl invented a time machine, and according to Rule1 \"if the peafowl created a time machine, then the peafowl suspects the truthfulness of the dugong\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule8 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the peafowl has a card whose color starts with the letter \"b\"\" and for Rule10 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the peafowl has more than 12 friends\", so we can conclude \"the peafowl suspects the truthfulness of the dugong\". We know the peafowl suspects the truthfulness of the dugong and the leopard borrows one of the weapons of the dugong, and according to Rule5 \"if the peafowl suspects the truthfulness of the dugong and the leopard borrows one of the weapons of the dugong, then the dugong does not invest in the company whose owner is the zebra\", and Rule5 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule2), so we can conclude \"the dugong does not invest in the company whose owner is the zebra\".

    "example": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The bulldog has thirteen friends, and is currently in Toronto. The flamingo has a card that is black in color. The gadwall leaves the houses occupied by the mule. The fangtooth does not leave the houses occupied by the akita. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the bulldog has a device to connect to the internet, then the bulldog stops the victory of the flamingo. Rule2: From observing that an animal does not stop the victory of the flamingo, one can conclude that it borrows one of the weapons of the dugong. Rule3: If you are positive that one of the animals does not leave the houses occupied by the akita, you can be certain that it will borrow a weapon from the bulldog without a doubt. Rule4: The flamingo will not tear down the castle that belongs to the bulldog if it (the flamingo) has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors. Rule5: The bulldog will not stop the victory of the flamingo if it (the bulldog) has more than 3 friends. Rule6: Here is an important piece of information about the flamingo: if it has something to drink then it does not tear down the castle of the bulldog for sure. Rule7: There exists an animal which leaves the houses that are occupied by the mule? Then the flamingo definitely tears down the castle that belongs to the bulldog.

Rule1: In order to conclude that the butterfly does not borrow one of the weapons of the poodle, two pieces of evidence are required: firstly that the camel will not bring an oil tank for the butterfly and secondly the woodpecker brings an oil tank for the butterfly. Rule2: If something invests in the company owned by the swallow and captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the coyote, then it will not bring an oil tank for the butterfly. Rule3: If the badger smiles at the camel, then the camel brings an oil tank for the butterfly. Rule4: Here is an important piece of information about the woodpecker: if it has fewer than eleven friends then it brings an oil tank for the butterfly for sure. Rule5: Regarding the woodpecker, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the akita's name, then we can conclude that it does not bring an oil tank for the butterfly. Rule6: Here is an important piece of information about the woodpecker: if it has a card with a primary color then it does not bring an oil tank for the butterfly for sure. Rule3 is preferred over Rule2. Rule5 is preferred over Rule4. Rule6 is preferred over Rule4. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the butterfly borrow one of the weapons of the poodle?",
    "proof": "We know the woodpecker has eight friends, 8 is fewer than 11, and according to Rule4 \"if the woodpecker has fewer than eleven friends, then the woodpecker brings an oil tank for the butterfly\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule5 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the woodpecker has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the akita's name\" and for Rule6 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the woodpecker has a card with a primary color\", so we can conclude \"the woodpecker brings an oil tank for the butterfly\".

And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the seahorse, if it has more than 7 friends, then we can conclude that it builds a power plant close to the green fields of the reindeer. Rule2: One of the rules of the game is that if the seahorse builds a power plant close to the green fields of the reindeer, then the reindeer will never build a power plant close to the green fields of the stork. Rule3: Be careful when something swears to the butterfly and also falls on a square of the lizard because in this case it will surely not build a power plant close to the green fields of the reindeer (this may or may not be problematic). Rule3 is preferred over Rule1. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the reindeer build a power plant near the green fields of the stork?",
