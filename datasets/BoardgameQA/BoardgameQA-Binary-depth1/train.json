You can conclude that it also proceeds to the spot right after the rabbit. Rule2: If the pig has a card whose color starts with the letter \"r\", then the pig does not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the rabbit. Rule2 is preferred over Rule1. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the pig proceed to the spot right after the rabbit?",
    "proof": "We know the pig becomes an enemy of the sea bass and the pig knocks down the fortress of the carp, and according to Rule1 \"if something becomes an enemy of the sea bass and knocks down the fortress of the carp, then it proceeds to the spot right after the rabbit\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule2 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the pig has a card whose color starts with the letter \"r\"\", so we can conclude \"the pig proceeds to the spot right after the rabbit\". So the statement \"the pig proceeds to the spot right after the rabbit\" is proved and the answer is \"yes\".",
