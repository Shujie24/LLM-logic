Rule2: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, swims in the pool next to the house of the zebra, then the badger dances with the pigeon undoubtedly. Rule3: Regarding the swan, if it has something to sit on, then we can conclude that it swims inside the pool located besides the house of the zebra. Rule4: The badger will unite with the wolf if it (the badger) is more than 10 months old. Rule5: Here is an important piece of information about the swan: if it has more money than the dove and the beetle combined then it swims inside the pool located besides the house of the zebra for sure. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the badger dance with the pigeon?",
    "proof": "We know the swan has 85 dollars, the dove has 21 dollars and the beetle has 9 dollars, 85 is more than 21+9=30 which is the total money of the dove and beetle combined, and according to Rule5 \"if the swan has more money than the dove and the beetle combined, then the swan swims in the pool next to the house of the zebra\", so we can conclude \"the swan swims in the pool next to the house of the zebra\". We know the swan swims in the pool next to the house of the zebra, and according to Rule2 \"if at least one animal swims in the pool next to the house of the zebra, then the badger dances with the pigeon\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule1 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the badger invests in the company whose owner is the peafowl\", so we can conclude \"the badger dances with the pigeon\".

Rule2: The cobra will unite with the gorilla if it (the cobra) has published a high-quality paper. Rule3: If something unites with the gorilla, then it smiles at the monkey, too. Rule4: Regarding the cobra, if it has a basketball that fits in a 24.7 x 25.2 x 10.8 inches box, then we can conclude that it does not unite with the gorilla. Rule5: Here is an important piece of information about the cobra: if it is in Turkey at the moment then it does not unite with the gorilla for sure. Rule4 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule2. Rule5 is preferred over Rule1. Rule5 is preferred over Rule2. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the cobra smile at the monkey?",
    "proof": "We know the cobra has thirteen friends, 13 is more than 3, and according to Rule1 \"if the cobra has more than three friends, then the cobra unites with the gorilla\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule5 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the cobra is in Turkey at the moment\" and for Rule4 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the cobra has a basketball that fits in a 24.7 x 25.2 x 10.8 inches box\", so we can conclude \"the cobra unites with the gorilla\".

Rule2: The gorilla does not surrender to the elk whenever at least one animal creates a castle for the poodle. Rule3: If the swallow is less than 5 years old, then the swallow captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the gorilla. Rule4: There exists an animal which dances with the duck? Then, the swallow definitely does not capture the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the gorilla. Rule5: Regarding the beaver, if it is in France at the moment, then we can conclude that it does not disarm the gorilla. Rule6: If the swallow captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the gorilla and the beaver does not disarm the gorilla, then, inevitably, the gorilla surrenders to the elk. Rule7: The beaver will not disarm the gorilla if it (the beaver) is more than 2 years old. Rule2 is preferred over Rule6. Rule4 is preferred over Rule1. Rule4 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the gorilla surrender to the elk?",
    "proof": "We know the beaver is 5 and a half years old, 5 and half years is more than 2 years, and according to Rule7 \"if the beaver is more than 2 years old, then the beaver does not disarm the gorilla\", so we can conclude \"the beaver does not disarm the gorilla\".

Rule2: Here is an important piece of information about the bear: if it works in computer science and engineering then it tears down the castle that belongs to the gadwall for sure. Rule3: Be careful when something destroys the wall constructed by the crow and also tears down the castle that belongs to the gadwall because in this case it will surely not neglect the akita (this may or may not be problematic). Rule4: Regarding the basenji, if it works in agriculture, then we can conclude that it does not swim in the pool next to the house of the bear. Rule5: Regarding the bear, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the peafowl's name, then we can conclude that it destroys the wall built by the crow. Rule6: The bear will tear down the castle that belongs to the gadwall if it (the bear) has a card whose color appears in the flag of Netherlands. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the bear neglect the akita?",
    "proof": "We know the bear has a card that is red in color, red appears in the flag of Netherlands, and according to Rule6 \"if the bear has a card whose color appears in the flag of Netherlands, then the bear tears down the castle that belongs to the gadwall\", so we can conclude \"the bear tears down the castle that belongs to the gadwall\".

Rule1: Here is an important piece of information about the camel: if it works in education then it does not trade one of the pieces in its possession with the mannikin for sure. Rule2: This is a basic rule: if the llama acquires a photograph of the camel, then the conclusion that \"the camel trades one of its pieces with the mannikin\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule3: For the mannikin, if the belief is that the camel trades one of the pieces in its possession with the mannikin and the peafowl does not trade one of its pieces with the mannikin, then you can add \"the mannikin destroys the wall constructed by the crab\" to your conclusions. Rule4: Regarding the camel, if it has something to carry apples and oranges, then we can conclude that it does not trade one of its pieces with the mannikin. Rule5: The peafowl will not trade one of its pieces with the mannikin if it (the peafowl) has more money than the reindeer. Rule6: The peafowl will not trade one of the pieces in its possession with the mannikin if it (the peafowl) has a card with a primary color. Rule1 is preferred over Rule2. Rule4 is preferred over Rule2. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the mannikin destroy the wall constructed by the crab?",
    "proof": "We know the peafowl has 83 dollars and the reindeer has 47 dollars, 83 is more than 47 which is the reindeer's money, and according to Rule5 \"if the peafowl has more money than the reindeer, then the peafowl does not trade one of its pieces with the mannikin\", so we can conclude \"the peafowl does not trade one of its pieces with the mannikin\". We know the llama acquires a photograph of the camel, and according to Rule2 \"if the llama acquires a photograph of the camel, then the camel trades one of its pieces with the mannikin\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule4 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the camel has something to carry apples and oranges\" and for Rule1 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the camel works in education\", so we can conclude \"the camel trades one of its pieces with the mannikin\".

The walrus has a basketball with a diameter of 22 inches, has four friends that are mean and four friends that are not, and does not leave the houses occupied by the poodle. The walrus does not hide the cards that she has from the ostrich. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The mule will not surrender to the reindeer if it (the mule) is in Canada at the moment. Rule2: If you see that something does not leave the houses occupied by the poodle and also does not hide her cards from the ostrich, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it also borrows one of the weapons of the reindeer. Rule3: If the camel has more money than the chihuahua, then the camel dances with the reindeer. Rule4: The mule will surrender to the reindeer if it (the mule) has more money than the dachshund and the fangtooth combined. Rule5: The camel will not dance with the reindeer if it (the camel) is in Germany at the moment. Rule6: The camel will not dance with the reindeer if it (the camel) has a card whose color starts with the letter \"r\". Rule7: For the reindeer, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) that the mule does not surrender to the reindeer and 2) that the camel does not dance with the reindeer, then you can add that the reindeer will never fall on a square that belongs to the akita to your conclusions. Rule8: One of the rules of the game is that if the walrus borrows one of the weapons of the reindeer, then the reindeer will, without hesitation, fall on a square that belongs to the akita. Rule1 is preferred over Rule4. Rule5 is preferred over Rule3. Rule6 is preferred over Rule3. Rule8 is preferred over Rule7. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the reindeer fall on a square of the akita?",
    "proof": "We know the walrus does not leave the houses occupied by the poodle and the walrus does not hide the cards that she has from the ostrich, and according to Rule2 \"if something does not leave the houses occupied by the poodle and does not hide the cards that she has from the ostrich, then it borrows one of the weapons of the reindeer\", so we can conclude \"the walrus borrows one of the weapons of the reindeer\". We know the walrus borrows one of the weapons of the reindeer, and according to Rule8 \"if the walrus borrows one of the weapons of the reindeer, then the reindeer falls on a square of the akita\", and Rule8 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule7), so we can conclude \"the reindeer falls on a square of the akita\". So the statement \"the reindeer falls on a square of the akita\" is proved and the answer is \"yes\".",
