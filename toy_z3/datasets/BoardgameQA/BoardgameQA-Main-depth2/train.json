The cockroach has a cell phone, has a cello, has seven friends that are energetic and one friend that is not, and is named Max. The elephant knocks down the fortress of the hippopotamus. The squirrel gives a magnifier to the ferret. The wolverine is named Pashmak. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the cockroach has something to drink, then the cockroach proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the tilapia. Rule2: Regarding the cockroach, if it has more than 2 friends, then we can conclude that it does not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the tilapia. Rule3: Be careful when something does not proceed to the spot right after the tilapia but shows her cards (all of them) to the black bear because in this case it certainly does not need support from the rabbit (this may or may not be problematic). Rule4: If the hippopotamus raises a flag of peace for the cockroach and the squirrel attacks the green fields whose owner is the cockroach, then the cockroach needs support from the rabbit. Rule5: Regarding the cockroach, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the wolverine's name, then we can conclude that it does not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the tilapia. Rule6: If the cockroach has a device to connect to the internet, then the cockroach proceeds to the spot right after the tilapia. Rule7: The hippopotamus unquestionably raises a peace flag for the cockroach, in the case where the elephant knocks down the fortress of the hippopotamus. Rule8: The squirrel does not attack the green fields of the cockroach, in the case where the carp shows her cards (all of them) to the squirrel. Rule9: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals gives a magnifier to the ferret, you can be certain that it will also attack the green fields of the cockroach. Rule2 is preferred over Rule1. Rule2 is preferred over Rule6. Rule3 is preferred over Rule4. Rule5 is preferred over Rule1. Rule5 is preferred over Rule6. Rule8 is preferred over Rule9. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the cockroach need support from the rabbit?",
    "proof": "We know the squirrel gives a magnifier to the ferret, and according to Rule9 \"if something gives a magnifier to the ferret, then it attacks the green fields whose owner is the cockroach\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule8 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the carp shows all her cards to the squirrel\", so we can conclude \"the squirrel attacks the green fields whose owner is the cockroach\". We know the elephant knocks down the fortress of the hippopotamus, and according to Rule7 \"if the elephant knocks down the fortress of the hippopotamus, then the hippopotamus raises a peace flag for the cockroach\", so we can conclude \"the hippopotamus raises a peace flag for the cockroach\".

Rule2: If you see that something attacks the green fields whose owner is the zander but does not know the defense plan of the penguin, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not respect the koala. Rule3: The leopard unquestionably respects the koala, in the case where the polar bear knows the defensive plans of the leopard.",
    "preferences": "Rule2 is preferred over Rule3. ",
    "example": "A few players are playing a boardgame. The current state of the game is as follows. The polar bear knows the defensive plans of the leopard. The leopard does not know the defensive plans of the penguin. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If something respects the koala, then it raises a peace flag for the oscar, too. Rule2: If you see that something attacks the green fields whose owner is the zander but does not know the defense plan of the penguin, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it does not respect the koala. Rule3: The leopard unquestionably respects the koala, in the case where the polar bear knows the defensive plans of the leopard. Rule2 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the leopard raise a peace flag for the oscar?",
    "proof": "We know the polar bear knows the defensive plans of the leopard, and according to Rule3 \"if the polar bear knows the defensive plans of the leopard, then the leopard respects the koala\", and for the conflicting and higher priority rule Rule2 we cannot prove the antecedent \"the leopard attacks the green fields whose owner is the zander\", so we can conclude \"the leopard respects the koala\". We know the leopard respects the koala, and according to Rule1 \"if something respects the koala, then it raises a peace flag for the oscar\", so we can conclude \"the leopard raises a peace flag for the oscar\". So the statement \"the leopard raises a peace flag for the oscar\" is proved and the answer is \"yes\".",
    "goal": "(leopard, raise, oscar)",
