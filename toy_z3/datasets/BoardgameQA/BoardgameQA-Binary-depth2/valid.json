The cricket is named Chickpea. The kiwi has a card that is orange in color, and is named Beauty. The penguin is named Blossom. The sheep is named Cinnamon. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: If the kiwi has a card with a primary color, then the kiwi does not hold the same number of points as the carp. Rule2: Regarding the cricket, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the sheep's name, then we can conclude that it sings a victory song for the carp. Rule3: Regarding the kiwi, if it has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the penguin's name, then we can conclude that it does not hold an equal number of points as the carp. Rule4: If the cow does not attack the green fields whose owner is the carp and the kiwi does not hold the same number of points as the carp, then the carp will never proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the zander. Rule5: If the cricket purchased a time machine, then the cricket sings a victory song for the carp. Rule6: Regarding the cow, if it has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then we can conclude that it does not attack the green fields of the carp. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the carp proceed to the spot right after the zander?",
    "proof": "We know the kiwi is named Beauty and the penguin is named Blossom, both names start with \"B\", and according to Rule3 \"if the kiwi has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the penguin's name, then the kiwi does not hold the same number of points as the carp\", so we can conclude \"the kiwi does not hold the same number of points as the carp\". We know the cow has a card that is blue in color, blue is one of the rainbow colors, and according to Rule6 \"if the cow has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then the cow does not attack the green fields whose owner is the carp\", so we can conclude \"the cow does not attack the green fields whose owner is the carp\". We know the cow does not attack the green fields whose owner is the carp and the kiwi does not hold the same number of points as the carp, and according to Rule4 \"if the cow does not attack the green fields whose owner is the carp and the kiwi does not holds the same number of points as the carp, then the carp does not proceed to the spot right after the zander\", so we can conclude \"the carp does not proceed to the spot right after the zander\". So the statement \"the carp proceeds to the spot right after the zander\" is disproved and the answer is \"no\".",
    "goal": "(carp, proceed, zander)",
