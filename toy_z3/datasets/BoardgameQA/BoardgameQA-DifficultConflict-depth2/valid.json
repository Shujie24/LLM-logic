Rule1: If the elephant becomes an actual enemy of the oscar, then the oscar needs support from the eel.

The spider has a cello, and holds the same number of points as the koala. The cheetah does not raise a peace flag for the spider. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Be careful when something respects the puffin but does not remove from the board one of the pieces of the puffin because in this case it will, surely, not proceed to the spot that is right after the spot of the viperfish (this may or may not be problematic). Rule2: Regarding the spider, if it has something to carry apples and oranges, then we can conclude that it does not respect the puffin. Rule3: If the spider has a card with a primary color, then the spider removes one of the pieces of the puffin. Rule4: If something does not burn the warehouse that is in possession of the jellyfish, then it proceeds to the spot that is right after the spot of the viperfish. Rule5: If the spider has difficulty to find food, then the spider does not respect the puffin. Rule6: If the cheetah does not raise a peace flag for the spider however the canary winks at the spider, then the spider will not remove from the board one of the pieces of the puffin. Rule7: If you are positive that you saw one of the animals holds an equal number of points as the koala, you can be certain that it will also respect the puffin. Rule2 is preferred over Rule7.
