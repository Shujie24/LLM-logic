Rule1: Here is an important piece of information about the finch: if it has a basketball that fits in a 27.8 x 34.3 x 32.1 inches box then it does not build a power plant close to the green fields of the akita for sure. Rule2: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, suspects the truthfulness of the crab, then the reindeer is not going to stop the victory of the akita. Rule3: Here is an important piece of information about the finch: if it is watching a movie that was released before Richard Nixon resigned then it does not build a power plant close to the green fields of the akita for sure. Rule4: For the akita, if the belief is that the reindeer does not stop the victory of the akita and the finch does not build a power plant close to the green fields of the akita, then you can add \"the akita hugs the flamingo\" to your conclusions.

Rule3: Regarding the woodpecker, if it has more than 9 friends, then we can conclude that it creates a castle for the dove.
