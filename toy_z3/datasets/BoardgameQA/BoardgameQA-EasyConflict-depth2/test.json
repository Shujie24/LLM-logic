Rule1: This is a basic rule: if the cougar invests in the company whose owner is the basenji, then the conclusion that \"the basenji will not hug the beetle\" follows immediately and effectively. Rule2: For the basenji, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) the bear does not negotiate a deal with the basenji and 2) the llama invests in the company whose owner is the basenji, then you can add \"basenji tears down the castle that belongs to the starling\" to your conclusions.

The butterfly does not refuse to help the mannikin. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Be careful when something hides her cards from the mannikin but does not refuse to help the mannikin because in this case it will, surely, want to see the bee (this may or may not be problematic). Rule2: If there is evidence that one animal, no matter which one, refuses to help the butterfly, then the otter is not going to hide her cards from the bee. Rule3: One of the rules of the game is that if the bison negotiates a deal with the butterfly, then the butterfly will never want to see the bee. Rule4: If the otter does not hide the cards that she has from the bee however the butterfly wants to see the bee, then the bee will not leave the houses that are occupied by the peafowl. Rule5: If the dolphin is in Africa at the moment, then the dolphin brings an oil tank for the bee. Rule1 is preferred over Rule3. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the bee leave the houses occupied by the peafowl?",
    "proof": "We know the butterfly hides the cards that she has from the mannikin and the butterfly does not refuse to help the mannikin, and according to Rule1 \"if something hides the cards that she has from the mannikin but does not refuse to help the mannikin, then it wants to see the bee\", and Rule1 has a higher preference than the conflicting rules (Rule3), so we can conclude \"the butterfly wants to see the bee\".

The crow has 35 dollars. The crow is watching a movie from 2012. The worm captures the king of the coyote. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: The coyote will not dance with the butterfly if it (the coyote) does not have her keys. Rule2: The crow will surrender to the coyote if it (the crow) is watching a movie that was released after SpaceX was founded. Rule3: Be careful when something shouts at the mouse but does not dance with the butterfly because in this case it will, surely, refuse to help the dragon (this may or may not be problematic). Rule4: If the crow surrenders to the coyote and the seahorse swears to the coyote, then the coyote will not refuse to help the dragon. Rule5: Regarding the crow, if it has more money than the basenji, then we can conclude that it surrenders to the coyote. Rule6: The coyote unquestionably shouts at the mouse, in the case where the worm captures the king (i.e. the most important piece) of the coyote. Rule7: If the coyote has a card whose color is one of the rainbow colors, then the coyote does not dance with the butterfly. Rule4 is preferred over Rule3.

Rule8: Regarding the coyote, if it has fewer than 1 friend, then we can conclude that it does not smile at the cobra.

The mermaid does not surrender to the frog. And the rules of the game are as follows. Rule1: Regarding the songbird, if it has more than 8 friends, then we can conclude that it does not dance with the frog. Rule2: If the songbird has a name whose first letter is the same as the first letter of the pelikan's name, then the songbird does not dance with the frog. Rule3: The frog will not build a power plant near the green fields of the duck if it (the frog) has a leafy green vegetable. Rule4: For the frog, if you have two pieces of evidence 1) that mermaid does not surrender to the frog and 2) that liger wants to see the frog, then you can add frog will never create a castle for the ant to your conclusions. Rule5: The frog creates one castle for the ant whenever at least one animal swims inside the pool located besides the house of the crab. Rule6: If you see that something does not build a power plant close to the green fields of the duck but it creates a castle for the ant, what can you certainly conclude? You can conclude that it is not going to shout at the lizard. Rule4 is preferred over Rule5. Based on the game state and the rules and preferences, does the frog shout at the lizard?",
